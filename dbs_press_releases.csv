Digital Duopoly: US and China Dominate Global Digital Economy | Bahasa,21 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Digital_Duopoly_US_and_China_Dominate_Global_Digital_Economy, Indonesia ,"- Technology development makes it easier for people to carry out their daily activities, especially after the pandemic broke out in the first quarter of this year. The pandemic has created promising opportunities for the digital economy, triggering a race among countries to build capable digital economy ecosystems. In today's digital industry, what happens is not a competition between developed and developing countries as the industry is concentrated in two countries - one a developed country and the other a developing country, namely the US and China. According to the “Digital Economy Report 2019” published by UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), the US and China control about 90% of the market value of the 70 largest digital platforms in the world and own about 75% of all patents related to blockchain technology. They are also responsible for about 50% of global spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) and control 75% of the cloud computing market. Then, what can other countries do to dismantle this increasingly powerful digital duopoly defense? Head of Telecom, Media & Technology Research, DBS Bank Singapore, Sachin Mittal, offers his insights on the current global digital conditions and the efforts that can be made to create market efficiency for other players. As a banking institution that is always active in providing comprehensive insights on economics and politics, DBS Group Research, which is part of DBS Bank, observes, analyses, and presents views on the latest conditions and trends in Asia and globally. Following is a summary of views on the current global digital competition: Why the rich are getting richer Digital competition is dominated by players with access to consumer data or big data, preventing smaller local players from flourishing. ""Unlike digital giants, small competitors and traditional incumbents do not have access to customer data,"" said Sachin. As an Illustration, take search engine companies that are allegedly prioritising their own services over those of their competitors, or e-commerce players who use their data algorithms to prioritise their own goods over the products of third-party sellers. Currently, large tech companies are under scrutiny to determine whether they are unfairly using their store applications to hurt competitors. And it doesn’t stop there: large technology companies often acquire smaller competitors to prevent potential threats from new entrants, as early as possible. Take Facebook as an example. The company acquired its rival, Instagram, in 2012, and Whatsapp in 2014. As a result, the acquisitions of local startups early on by big players thwart market efficiency. Tips for other players to catch up As athletes strategize to win in matches, digital platforms should be regulated in such a way so as to enable a fair review of the strengths and weaknesses of each country before rules are established. Different countries have different problems and regulations that can solve them. To address issues on inefficient access to data, Sachin suggested an approach that focuses on three areas, namely data privacy, data localisation, and/or universal data. ""First is data privacy. In May 2018, the European Union (EU) introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to harmonise data privacy laws of all its members. To date, around 120 countries have enacted data protection laws while about 40 countries and jurisdictions have yet to finalise their bills,"" explained Sachin. Although strict and all-encompassing regulations protect data privacy, Sachin believes they often hurt market efficiency and disadvantage smaller companies but indirectly benefit digital giants. Data collection is an integral part of a business, and stopping data collection practices puts pressure on smaller players who fear of being accused of noncompliance. Apart from data privacy, Sachin also stated that data localisation needs attention. ""Every country needs to localise data. Several countries such as Vietnam address the issue of inefficiency through mandatory data localisation and the requirement for digital platform companies to open local offices in the country. Such policies not only encourage the development of data centers but also create jobs, benefit the economy, and facilitate tax collection."" Sachin added that universal data access is an important element, especially in creating a level playing field for smaller players. But, to promote data sharing and access, privacy and security risks must be a top priority, as in the case of India, where talks are underway regarding the requirement for digital companies to sell public data or non-personal data to anyone who needs access to a database in that country. Just as governments control land to build roads, they expect data owners to act in the national interest. Indonesia: Tapping into opportunities without bias Thanks to the high participation of high social media, Indonesia's digital economy has grown rapidly over the past decade. With six unicorns - Gojek, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Traveloka, OVO, and JD.ID- Indonesia's digital economy is currently the largest and fastest growing in Southeast Asia, despite a lack of regulations on personal data protection. ""Given the potential, if Indonesia enforces regulations on universal data access, or allows the release of public data for a fee, then local companies could catch up, help reduce gaps, and overcome local challenges that are less relevant to global players,"" said Sachin. Although it looks simple, Sachin added, “Digital giants have the financial power to lobby regulators to issue regulations that benefit them. Therefore, to stimulate the right steps, many developing countries, including Indonesia, need support from Europe, Japan, regional bodies as well as multilateral organisations. Otherwise, the lobbying power of large digital platforms will be hard to beat. "" Using the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as reference, Indonesia has drafted a bill on the protection of personal data (RUU PDP), which is currently being reviewed by parliament. When the bill is passed into law, Indonesia will join more than 120 countries that have enacted data protection laws. In 2012, Indonesia enforced strict data localisation policies to increase control over state data. However, in October 2019, the requirements for data localisation were relaxed to encourage foreign investment. Since then, data localisation regulations only apply to public entities and entities that operate digital platforms on behalf of the public, where all the players must ensure that their platforms and digital data are accessible to regulators regardless of location. Given the challenges and conditions of the digital economy today, each country takes a mix of approaches that suit its own realities and circumstances.

DBS Bank provides SGD40 million loan facility to Sembcorp Industries for Singapore's first single large-scale floating solar photovoltaic system,20 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_provides_SGD40_million_loan_facility_to_Sembcorp_Industries_for_Singapores_first_single_large_scale_floating_solar_photovoltaic_system, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank has provided a SGD40 million loan facility to Sembcorp Industries (Sembcorp) to build a 60 megawatt-peak (MWp) floating solar photovoltaic (PV) system on Tengeh Reservoir in Tuas. The bank is the sole financier for the project.  Scheduled to be completed in 2021, the project will be Singapore’s first single large-scale floating solar PV system as well as one of the world’s largest, inland floating solar PV systems. Awarded by PUB in February, the project will cover an area of around 45 football fields and generate enough energy to power about 16,000 four-room HDB flats for a year, offsetting about 32 kilotonnes of carbon emissions annually – equivalent to taking approximately 7,000 cars off the roads. Koh Chiap Khiong, Head of Singapore, Southeast Asia and China (Energy), Sembcorp Industries , said, “This floating solar PV system for PUB is a landmark project that demonstrates Sembcorp’s commitment and expertise in developing large-scale renewable energy projects to contribute to Singapore’s transition to a low-carbon economy. We are pleased to have DBS Bank as the sole financing partner for this project as we build an advanced and sustainable platform to deliver long-term value for PUB and Singapore.” Lim Wee Seng, Head of Energy, Chemicals and Infrastructure, DBS Bank , said, “Enabling renewable energy financing is at the core of DBS’ agenda and is one of the key tenets of our sustainability strategy. We are heartened to support Sembcorp Industries in this landmark transaction which demonstrates Singapore’s transition towards a low-carbon economy. It builds on our recent financial advisory roles in Taiwan’s largest floating solar project and also Taiwan’s largest ground-mounted solar project – and that’s where DBS seeks to differentiate itself in renewables financing – capturing financial advisory opportunities so we shape and influence early. Despite Covid-19, we closed the two solar financial advisory mandates in Taiwan and garnered four new advisory mandates across solar, wind and geothermal assets in Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam this year.” With this project, Sembcorp will be one of the largest renewable energy players in Singapore with approximately 240MWp of solar capacity in the country. The project also underscores Singapore’s continued efforts to work towards achieving its solar target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. DBS’ commitment in developing Asia’s renewables landscape Since 2018, DBS has completed 29 renewable projects amounting to around SGD3.6 billion across Asia. The bank also has strong expertise in advising and arranging for financing across a broad spectrum of renewable energy projects in Singapore and the region, in areas such as floating solar and rooftops, onshore and offshore wind, hydro, and geothermal. “Renewable energy has been scaling up rapidly across the region over the last decade, giving rise to the need for more financing to fund its development, especially in developing countries, to meet climate and sustainable development goals. As a purpose-driven bank and as part of our commitment to develop Asia’s renewables landscape, we have dedicated SGD10 billion to finance renewable and clean energy development across the region by 2024, with an expected double-digit growth annually,” said Lim. Walking the talk, DBS is also the first Asian bank and Singapore company to join the global renewable energy initiative, RE100 , and has committed to utilising 100% renewable energy across all its markets, with an interim target of 100% in Singapore by 2030. To date, DBS has been making steady progress with about 14% of the bank’s total electricity consumption across its six core markets derived from renewable sources.

DBS Asian Insights Conference 2020: Navigating a Post-Pandemic World | Bahasa,19 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Asian_Insights_Conference_2020_Navigating_a_Post_Pandemic_World_ID, Indonesia ,"- DBS is proud to host its first digital edition of the DBS Asian Insights Conference 2020, bringing together a distinguished group of global thought leaders, C-suite executives and subject matter experts to discuss the most pressing and pertinent issues people and businesses will face in a post-Covid world. The bank’s flagship biennial event took place over 23 and 24 July, and was joined by an audience of more than 2,200 delegates, comprising government leaders, top business executives and investors from both the public and private sectors around the world.  The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly changed the way businesses and societies function, with many seeking direction on ways to circumvent the challenges in a post-pandemic world. A crisis of this magnitude will also see people around the world review their priorities and purpose, as economies and businesses begin to reopen and build back better. Under the conference theme of “Navigating a post-pandemic world”, panel speakers shared their insights on a variety of topics including economics and markets, food security, and how to leverage technology as a force of good. The conference content was curated with the aim to provide actionable views which will help governments, businesses and individuals work towards a more resilient future. To quote DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, it is clear that people the world over are striving to improve their lives, but things have yet to return to normal. According to Piyush, quite a lot of businesses have been able to adjust to the disruptions resulting from the pandemic. However, the pandemic has posed quite serious challenges to big companies as digitalization is more urgent than ever to meet the needs of customers and employees. Piyush explained that digitalization has brought changes in many areas, including in the ways of working. Apart from the challenges, digitalization provides opportunities to reallocate financial and human resources and enables businesses to gain customers and human capital beyond their areas of operations. Furthermore, Piyush stated that sustainability will be a big driver in the next 10 to 20 years affecting changes in three areas, namely changes in the value system and community commitment; changes in expectations - what investors want, what people want- as well as business opportunities. Lastly, Piyush stated that only companies that are ready to adapt to changes and remain agile can ensure a successful future. One of the highlights of the conference was DBS Asia Leadership Dialogue with Al Gore, former US Vice President and winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, on “Climate Change and Great Reset”, hosted by DBS CEO Piyush Gupta. Al Gore urged people to make choices to change policies and to speed up the use of new technologies. According to Al Gore, the green stimulus program is the most effective way to create new jobs and drive post-pandemic economic growth. Therefore, if we could make the right policies for a post-pandemic world, we can further accelerate the labor-intensive sustainability revolution. This year’s DBS Asian Insights Conference also marked the event’s 10 th anniversary. To reinforce the bank’s deep Asian insights and thought leadership in the region, DBS continues to expand the scope of the conference, which started as a market-focused event, to one which today is “borderless” and features a global panel of speakers who share their insights on the future of the world across a multitude of sectors, demographics and markets. Gavin Long, Co-Founder & Partner of The Acacia Group, in a session entitled “Economics of Mutuality, Finding Profitable Solutions to Problems of People & Planet” , said that Economics of Mutuality (EoM) is a new approach to invest that can maximize returns. EoM investment optimizes social, environmental, and financial impacts. With EoM investment, companies change their business operations to suit their human, social, natural, and financial resources to optimize profits and maximize shareholders and stakeholder's value. EoM investment creates highly resilient and profitable companies that optimize returns on invested capital in a sustainable manner.

DBS Private Bank's flagship portfolio hits new high of 7.0% in gains,19 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Private_Banks_flagship_portfolio_hits_new_high_of_7_0pct_in_gains, Singapore ,"- Despite widespread market volatility in the first half of the year, DBS Private Bank’s flagship investment portfolio – the DBS Chief Investment Office (CIO) Barbell Strategy Portfolio – has achieved a record performance of 7.0% (year-to-date as of 31 July 2020), outperforming the composite benchmark’s 2.2% gain. Designed to capitalise on long-term, irreversible growth trends while mitigating short-term volatility through income-generating assets, the portfolio’s two-pronged strategy has become especially relevant today as uncertainties persist. Currently, over SGD 1.2 billion of discretionary assets under management within DBS Private Bank reference this strategy.  Since launch date (28 August 2019) 1M 3M 6M YTD DBS CIO Barbell Strategy Portfolio 14.6% 6.2% 16.5% 5.4% 7.0% Composite benchmark [1] 8.3% 4.3% 8.9% 2.2% 2.2% Table 1: Returns statistics as of 31 July 2020 Said Hou Wey Fook, Chief Investment Officer, DBS Bank , “2020 has been a stark reminder for investors to be positioned for long-term resilience. Amid slower growth and rising bifurcation, and with the global pandemic and political tensions still on the world’s radar, it is more important than ever to take a well-diversified approach that also considers post-pandemic opportunities. The DBS CIO Barbell Strategy Portfolio represents the bank’s view of the future, and with its dual focus on growth and income, seeks to help clients navigate the road ahead by providing a resilient solution to form the bedrock of their investment portfolios.” DBS CIO Barbell Strategy Portfolio The DBS CIO Barbell Strategy Portfolio (the “Portfolio”) is a globally diversified portfolio comprising over 50 securities across a range of geographies, sectors and asset classes [2] . The Portfolio is unique to DBS as it mirrors the CIO’s investment calls and is designed based on two anchor components: Growth : Exposure to secular trends including digitalisation, e-Commerce, healthcare, millennials and China equities Income : Seeks to generate a steady income stream for downside protection via exposure to dividend equities, REITs and corporate bonds Conceptualised, developed and actively managed in-house, the Portfolio is built on a combination of top-down asset allocation and bottom-up stock selection. The CIO sets the overall investment strategy, asset allocation and sector exposure based on its macro-economic and thematic trends, while portfolio construction and stock selection rely on the extensive research expertise and stringent curation of the bank’s research, discretionary portfolio management (DPM) and product teams. Accredited investors from DBS Private Bank and DBS Treasures Private Client (TPC) can participate via the DBS CIO Barbell Note or the bank’s DPM service. DBS CIO Barbell Note The DBS CIO Barbell Note (the “Note”) references the Portfolio. It is open-ended with no fixed maturity and is rebalanced monthly or upon update of portfolio components. It is available in six currencies, at a minimum investment sum of USD / SGD / EUR / AUD / CHF 100,000 or HKD 500,000. To enable investors to reap the full benefits of compounding, any dividend and coupon distributions from the Portfolio’s underlying instruments will be reinvested. DBS Discretionary Portfolio Management (DPM) Clients subscribed to DBS’ DPM service, which requires a minimum investment of SGD 5 million in discretionary assets under management, can also choose to participate in the Portfolio by channelling their funds into a mixed-asset discretionary mandate. These clients will receive any dividend and coupon pay-outs from the Portfolio, as the underlying instruments will be registered in their name. DBS’ “Topple the Barbell Challenge” To demonstrate its confidence in the Portfolio, DBS has also launched the “Topple the Barbell Challenge” – an inaugural initiative that invites clients to put the Portfolio to the test by challenging them to outperform the Portfolio’s return at the end of a designated 12-month period. Two prize categories will be awarded at the end of the challenge, with the top-performing 10% receiving 100,000 miles for every 1% mark-to-market final outperformance [3] . The best-performing client will also have SGD 50,000 donated in their name to a DBS-supported social enterprise or charitable organisation of their choice. Participation in the challenge requires a minimum entry amount of SGD 250,000 (or equivalent) and will be open to DBS Private Bank or DBS TPC clients on a first-come-first-serve basis.

DBS on Covid-19's impact on Singapore residents' financial health: more help needed for lower income group,18 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_on_Covid_19_s_impact_on_Singapore_residents__financial_health__more_help_needed_for_lower_income_group, Singapore ,"- Covid-19 has caused a severe disruption to global economic activity and its impact on the Singapore economy has been broad and significant. As Singapore continues her efforts to contain the pandemic and its economic repercussions, GDP growth is expected to sink to -6.5%, making this the worst recession since Independence. To better understand how Singapore residents [1] are managing their personal finances amidst and beyond the Covid-19 maelstrom, DBS Bank has published its first report of a new research series, the “ DBS NAV Financial Health Series ”. Findings of the report – a collaboration between DBS Group Research and DBS Financial Planning Group – are derived from a multi-layered analysis of macro-economic data and anonymised data insights from 1.2 million retail customers over the months of March, April and May this year. Here are the key findings: Indications of deep and broad-based income deterioration : The share of customers who experienced a significant (defined as more than 10%) decline in income has risen sharply to 26% in May. Among them, about one-third suffered even sharper income decline in excess of 50%. More support needed for lower income group : The lower income group is bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Lower income earners (defined as individuals who earn a monthly salary of SGD 2,999 and less) constitute about 49% of customers who experienced a drop in their pay checks. Within this group, about half (51%) saw their incomes decline by more than 50%. In comparison, the impact on the higher income groups is considerably modest. Lower income earners require more support as they are heavily reliant on their salary to meet their monthly cash flow needs. A sharp decline in salary would inflict significant stress on their livelihoods. In this instance, the extension of some of the government support measures, with a specific focus on the lower-income earners, would be welcome. Middle-aged individuals are vulnerable : While older workers were found to be marginally more vulnerable to income deterioration, those aged 35-44 years old account for the highest share of affected workers – the income of more than half (56%) in this age group plunged by 30% or more. This is partly due to current policy measures which have focused on job losses (in the case of older workers) and the lower income group. The middle-aged group is also considered the “sandwiched class” as they have more financial commitments, such as having two sets of dependants. Income deterioration of employees in the F&B, Hospitality and Aviation sectors is especially pronounced and worsening : In particular, the Aviation sector saw the largest spike, with 81% of individuals employed in this sector experiencing lower income in May, up from 39% in March 2020. Worry over income deterioration exacerbated by inadequate emergency funds : Concerns regarding income decline are even more compelling, considering that most of the affected individuals do not have adequate emergency savings. In May, 64% of individuals who experienced a significant fall in income had less than three months of emergency funds, with a sizeable 42% of this group having less than a month of emergency funds set aside. Amongst lower income earners, 33% had less than three months of emergency cash saved, of which 22% had less than a month of emergency funds set aside. An investment opportunity for savvy retail investors : When the equity markets plunged in March, a group of retail investors took the correction in stock prices as a buying opportunity for equities. As of June, these retail investors outperformed institutional investors and the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) by 6.8 percentage-points and 9.6 percentage-points respectively.  Specifically, these are individuals who understand the importance of financial planning, have lower financial commitments and who have set aside sufficient emergency funds.  They can be characterised by two qualities: The propensity to invest rises with income level: Individuals who earn above SGD 10,000 invest significantly more. This group has the highest percentage of investors at 12.2% for retail customers and 15.8% for NAV Planner users. Having more savings equates to a higher propensity to invest : DBS has observed a positive correlation between the level of emergency funds and income. For example, 54% of customers who earn SGD 10,000 or more have more than three months emergency funds set aside, compared to just 24% in the lower income group. Investment decisions are largely based on life-stages : Individuals aged 25 to 35 years have a higher tendency to invest likely because of their lower financial commitments, whereas those aged 35 to 54 years suffer a dip in their ability to do so, partly because they are at a life stage when their financial commitments are at their highest. The inclination to invest jumped for those in the 55 to 64 age band. This is likely due to lower financial commitments and their ability to access their CPF savings, which can be ploughed back into investments. Said Irvin Seah, Senior Economist, DBS Group Research: “The Covid-19 pandemic is a highly regressive event which could potentially widen the income gap in Singapore. Its impact on the various income groups has been disparate and uneven, and as we have found, skew unfavourably towards lower income earners. The Singapore government has swiftly introduced policy measures such as the Jobs Support Scheme which helped mitigate job losses, but more targeted policy intervention may be required to provide calibrated assistance to those that are worst affected.”  To help individuals and businesses alleviate the challenges they may face in managing their cashflows, DBS has rolled out three rounds of Covid-19 liquidity relief packages and also committed SGD 10.5 million in its “Stronger Together Fund” to provide meals and care packs for vulnerable individuals affected by the pandemic across its six key markets. In May, the bank also announced plans to hire more than 2,000 people in Singapore and pledged no job cuts.  Earlier in April, DBS introduced NAV Planner – an industry-first, feature-rich digital advisory solution leveraging big data and technology – which enables customers to independently plan and manage their finances by providing insights and recommendations tailored to their life stages and financial circumstances. More recently, the bank upgraded NAV Planner with a new “Map Your Money” feature and launched a retirement planning portal to help Singaporeans get a head start in planning for their golden years. This is in addition to the extensive library of financial planning-related guides, educational video clips and articles, as well as virtual financial literacy classes which are open to the public on its online NAV page.  More than one million users have since interacted with NAV Planner and NAV-related content, and close to 100,000 customers were able to turn their finances around to become net savers after doing so. “We are very encouraged to see our customers gain a more positive relationship with their finances through our NAV financial planning initiatives,” said Jeremy Soo, DBS Singapore Head of Consumer Banking Group. “The pandemic has also led many of our customers to reassess their protection plans and question if they are adequately covered. To address this, we will be implementing an enhanced NAV Planner module to help demystify and identify protection gaps.” Please click here to access the full report. ____________________________________________________________________________  [1] Refers to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents [END]  About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS Bank reaches out to people to rise together above pandemic through Portraits of Purpose campaign | Bahasa,18 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_reaches_out_to_people_to_rise_together_above_pandemic_through_Portraits_of_Purpose_campaign, Indonesia ,"- The Covid-19 pandemic is not showing signs of abating and has claimed countless lives and caused many people to lose their livelihoods. The world is struggling against the pandemic and the fallout from the virus. The need to “flatten the curve” to reduce the spread of Covid-19 reminds us that life is very precious. On the other hand, life and economy must keep running so that we can face the economic challenges. Therefore, the government decided to implement a policy of adapting to new habits or new normal to support national economic recovery. SGiven experience from past crises, the pandemic requires a collaborative effort of the entire community to work together to overcome it. Being a purpose-driven bank is the foundation of DBS Bank in carrying out its business operations. It is deeply rooted in DBS Bank's history and embedded in the culture as well as the company’s DNA. As a manifestation of this commitment, DBS Bank strives to make efforts to help customers, employees, and people deal with the current situation. S“Through the Portraits of Purpose campaign, DBS Bank wants to share stories that can inspire and give hope for everyone to fight together, particularly in the face of the pandemic, and to welcome the new normal. While the road ahead won’t be easy, we can make it through. Together, let’s forge the path ahead,” said President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia, Paulus Sutisna . SFor months since the pandemic started, Bank DBS Indonesia has increased the capacities and features of various digital banking services so that customers can carry out banking transactions safely from their homes. In May, Bank DBS Indonesia donated medical equipment and staple food worth SGD2.5 million or equivalent to 26.2 billion rupiah to the Task Force for the Acceleration of Covid-19 Handling. The donation, which was handed over through the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, was part of the donation made by DBS Group through the “DBS Stronger Together Fund” campaign to help people affected by Covid-19. In June, Temasek Foundation, through the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta, supported the “DBS Stronger Together Fund” campaign by donating meals and staple food packages to daily workers and people affected by Covid-19. The donation was distributed through the Confederation of All Indonesian Trade Union (KSBSI) and the Foodbank of Indonesia (FOI). Portraits of Purpose is not just stories from and about DBS Bank but collective stories about people’s tenacity and hope in facing this difficult time together. In difficult times as these, it is easy to be discouraged, but light born of hope, courage, perseverance and generosity shine brighter amid adversity. These beacons of life guide us forward, as we put one foot in front of another, toward a better future. PT Trimegah Asset Management had quite a challenging experience when the pandemic broke out. When the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) were introduced, PT Trimegah had to order employees to work remotely from home. However, working from home is not an easy habit to adopt as it needs a lot of support, from internet connection to digital banking services so that employees can carry out their jobs well.

DBS upskills employees in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning through gamified learning,17 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_upskills_employees_in_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Machine_Learning_through_gamified_learning, Singapore ,"- DBS is taking innovative steps to futureproof its workforce, announcing a collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop a critical mass of employees equipped with fundamental skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) by the end of the year. DBS Ray Goh emerged global champion in the recent virtual AWS DeepRacer League F1 ProAm Event DBS has set its sights on accelerating the use of AI and ML across its business. To enable this, DBS and AWS have jointly launched the DBS x AWS DeepRacer League. DBS employees will learn the basics of AI and ML by participating in a series of hands-on online tutorials before putting their new knowledge to the test by programming their own autonomous model race car. These ML models are then uploaded onto a virtual racing environment where employees can experiment and iteratively finetune their models as they engage each other in friendly competition. Paul Cobban, Chief Data and Transformation Officer at DBS, said, “As a technology company that provides banking services, we are keenly aware of the need to stay ahead of the technology curve to continue exceeding our customers’ expectations. We have never believed in limiting digital expertise to a small team. Instead, we passionately believe in democratising technology skillsets among all employees, so that they can run alongside the company as we advance on our digital transformation together. Additionally, we wanted to adopt a different approach from our previous digital and data skills revolutions. In line with our ethos of keeping work and learning fun, we sought to introduce gamification elements to better engage our employees, and the AWS DeepRacer League platform presented the perfect opportunity.” Through the DBS x AWS DeepRacer League, DBS expects at least 3,000 employees, including the bank’s senior leadership, will learn new AI and ML skills this year. The DBS x AWS DeepRacer League will also be run completely online powered by AWS, from classroom to racetrack, as part of DBS’ drive to ingrain digital learning behaviours among employees. This comes on the back of DBS’ effort to scale up its digital learning tools and platforms to enable its employees to upgrade their skills and pick up new knowledge even when they are not physically in the office. While smaller corporate AWS DeepRacer Leagues have been organised in other parts of the world, this is the largest among Asian-headquartered enterprises and one of the first in the world to be organised at scale by a financial institution. “The financial services industry is rapidly evolving, and DBS is again demonstrating why they are a global award-winning bank by transforming their workforce for the digital age and equipping them with the latest knowledge on cloud technology. We are excited to collaborate with DBS to develop a talent pool that can further unlock the flexibility and power of cloud technology,” said Conor McNamara, Managing Director, AWS ASEAN. “Congratulations to the DBS employees who have qualified to compete in the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup later this year.” Employees who develop a flair and passion for AI and ML are encouraged to stretch themselves beyond the DBS x AWS DeepRacer League and to pit their skills at global competitions. Ray Goh, Executive Director of Technology & Operations at DBS, flew Singapore’s flag high when he emerged global champion in the recent virtual AWS DeepRacer League F1 ProAm Event run in May 2020, even beating Renault F1 Team driver Daniel Ricciardo. Another four DBS employees were placed in the global Top 20, and a total of six employees have qualified for the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup to be held in Las Vegas at the close of the year. Ray Goh said, “When I first got involved with the AWS DeepRacer on my own last year, it was to satisfy my own hunger to learn more about AI and ML. I wanted to challenge myself by participating in the AWS DeepRacer League, but I certainly did not expect to come this far! I’m delighted to be able to do Singapore and DBS proud, and more importantly, to inspire my colleagues to join me in developing a deeper level of mastery in AI and ML, which are both important skills for the bank and the digital economy.” Since the start of its digital transformation seven years ago, DBS has invested heavily in upskilling its employees’ digitally so that no one is left behind on bank’s digital transformation journey. The bank’s investments have laid a strong foundation for everyone in the bank, from teller to executive, to leverage digital capabilities and data skillsets in developing innovative banking products and delivering exceptional service to customers. DBS is now revving up for the next stage of its digital transformation efforts as it continues experimenting with emerging technologies. For instance, in 2019, DBS digitalised and simplified end-to-end credit processing, setting the foundation for advanced credit risk management using data analytics and ML. It has also deployed an AI-powered engine to provide accurate self-service digital options to its retail customers based on their digital footprint.

Bank DBS Indonesia helps corporate customers run their businesses amid pandemic | Bahasa,14 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Bank_DBS_Indonesia_helps_corporate_customers_run_their_businesses_amid_pandemic, Indonesia ,"- The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted all business players, including fund management company PT Trimegah Asset Management, to rethink their business operations. PT Trimegah Asset Management Head of Operations and Settlements Vega Henrietta said, “We did not expect this virus to affect us because SARS did not affect us. In fact, there are no deadly viruses from other countries that have had such an impact on Indonesia.” When the number of people infected with the virus increased and the number of cases peaked to 117 in mid-March, PT Trimegah took action and asked its staff to work remotely from home. This is a new way of working that has created annoying little problems. Among the main issues of concern was whether PT Trimegah’s IT system could ensure seamless connection for remote working practices. With about IDR15 trillion in assets under the company’s management, the main issue faced by Vega is drawing up good contracts to complete transactions online. Usually, she asked clients to send copies of the agreements that have been signed by fax, but this has become an obstacle when employees work from home. “We assure our clients that we will maintain smooth operations because we have really good IT support and vendors. We also maintain close coordination with our custodian bank, Bank DBS Indonesia, brokers, as well as the Indonesia Stock Exchange,” Vega said. Fortunately, Bank DBS has several systems to assist its institutional investor base in digitizing their financial operations. DBS IDEAL, a corporate digital banking platform owned by Bank DBS, is a perfect solution for PT Trimegah in carrying out its day-to-day operations. ""Most of our customers use the platform but have not fully utilized all its features. Many still use it for basic things such as to check account balances rather than taking full advantage of its functions. When we started working from home in early March, we anticipated the need of customers to use some of the more sophisticated IDEAL features and helped them in a comprehensive manner,” said Sabina Susie Kosasih , Executive Director, Head of Financial Institutions Group, Bank DBS Indonesia. Aware of the need for customers to become proficient in using DBS IDEAL services, Bank DBS Indonesia focuses on their specific needs, especially in authenticating digital transactions. Bank DBS Indonesia has also accelerated the process of setting up the services needed and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to solve any problem. ""Everything is done for them through our digital network and we have a support team that helps everyone run IDEAL more confidently according to their needs, supported by our team that is always ready at all times,"" Susie added. ""We have found that working from home can be a solution if we face situations that prevent us from going to the office in the future. DBS IDEAL can help us monitor our transactions and carry out our daily approval process,"" said Vega. With DBS IDEAL, PT Trimegah can authenticate transactions digitally.

DBS and Singaporean fintech Doxa launch construction industry’s first automated supplier payments solution; Tiong Seng group signs on as pioneer adopter,13 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Singaporean_fintech_Doxa_launch_construction_industrys_first_automated_supplier_payments_solution_Tiong_Seng_group_signs_on_as_pioneer_adopter, Singapore ,"- DBS today introduced Singapore’s first automated supplier procure-to-pay solution for the construction sector, developed by Singaporean fintech Doxa. Named Doxa Connex, the payments solution is a first for the sector in Singapore and it aims to help main contractors improve cashflow management with their suppliers as well as lift productivity and efficiency as they go all out to re-start projects after the extended circuit breaker. Main contractor Tiong Seng Group has signed up as the pioneer adopter. Doxa Connex hopes to help main contractors eliminate often manual administrative processes that plague the construction industry. By automating payments from main contractor to supplier, Doxa Connex automatically tracks the entire process from a main contractor’s invitation to quote all the way to procurement orders to delivery orders to last mile payments. Chew Chong Lim, Managing Director and Global Head of Real Estate, Institutional Banking, DBS said that the solution was conceptualised ground-up through several industry workshops organised with Tiong Seng Group and their supplier network at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in February this year. “The purpose of the workshops was to understand and solve the construction industry’s pain points with a view to increase cashflow efficiency which is the lifeblood of the industry. Doxa Connex was also developed with a view to improve productivity and remove inefficiencies in the sector’s procurement and payment processes. These processes may look simple on paper but in reality are often cumbersome and fraught with missing documentation and patchy administration due to paper-based invoices and delivery orders having to change hands multiple times along the way.” Once the solution was conceptualised, DBS and Tiong Seng Group then worked with Doxa through numerous ideation and solutioning workshops, which were run using DBS’ in-house 4D (Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver) methodology to build Singapore’s first automated supplier procure-to-pay solution. Accounting for more than 4% of Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product, the construction industry has in recent years taken steps to embrace technology along the construction value chain. However, a recent study by Autodesk and IDC [1] noted that only 2% of construction firms have automated most of their manual processes and the sector continues to rely heavily on manual and paper-based payment processes, with payments done predominantly using paper-based cheques. Dr. John Keung, Chairman of Tiong Seng Contractors (Pte) Ltd, said that while the extended Circuit Breaker period had disrupted the operating cycles of all economies, it also highlighted the importance of digital connectivity along the value chain. “As a leading local contractor, Tiong Seng is keenly aware of the need to embrace Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) in the entire value chain of the built environment sector, as promoted by the industry and the government in recent years. We have thus made digitalisation one of our core drivers for industry transformation. It is therefore an opportune time for us to make another major step toward IDD by launching Doxa Connex within Tiong Seng to spearhead the digital revolution of the built environment sector in Singapore and improve productivity as a whole. “At Tiong Seng, innovation has always been at the heart of our organisation and DNA. As a result, integrating digitalisation within our business processes has been a natural progression for us over the years, and we are strong believers that these digital solutions are the best way forward for the industry as well. We are excited to collaborate with DBS who shares the same vision that has led to the launch of Doxa Connex that we see today. With Doxa Connex, industry practitioners will be freed up from tedious paper-based processes, receive payments expeditiously and seamlessly, and enjoy time savings that will enable them to shift focus toward higher value work. We hope our partners and all in the industry will join us in making full use of Doxa Connex to drive up productivity and to save manpower.” According to data from Doxa, Doxa Connex digitalises and automates the majority of the manual procurement and payment processes and documentation, which could lead to a reduction in administrative fees and processing costs of at least 50%. Tiong Seng Group can also expect to reap time savings from the streamlined procure-to-pay (P2P) process and enjoy a significant reduction in working days required for administrative tasks enabling it to redeploy their employees to focus on higher-value work. Chew added, “Covid-19 has accelerated the need for many industries to turn to digital solutions to continue operating safely even amid manpower constraints, and the construction sector is no exception. Proactive and timely digital transformation will put construction companies in good stead for recovery and growth when economic activity picks up and demand for construction services resumes.” Edmund Ng, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Doxa, said, “It has been a privilege to work with DBS and Tiong Seng to develop Singapore’s first supplier automated payments solution and to have the opportunity to implement this with Tiong Seng for the construction industry. Being a fintech start-up, we can empathise and relate to the challenges of having payments delayed, especially during this period of economic uncertainty. We hope to continue this journey with DBS to develop solutions that equip companies with the right tools to navigate the uncertainties of the post-Covid reality. I believe that digital transformation is the right step forward, regardless of the size of the company or industry.” Janet Ang, Chairman of Singapore Business Federation’s Digitalisation Committee, said that she was heartened that the construction industry is determined to recover and emerge stronger from this pandemic. She said, “The construction industry is facing a pivotal moment, buffeted by strong headwinds. However, these are seasoned and practical businessmen who have weathered many storms and I’m sure that if they banded together to tackle cashflow challenges, re-deploy and train their valuable resources to higher value work, the industry as a whole will be able to ride out this difficult season. For that to happen, digitalisation will be the key. Solutions like Doxa Connex are a good step in the right direction and mirror our continuous efforts to promote the adoption of digital solutions and technology amongst our various industry members.” Ms. Ang further emphasised the importance for business leaders to continuously explore, engage and extend digitalisation tools, and for companies to equip their employees with relevant skillsets and competencies, and be ready for a productive and purposeful digital transformation journey. She urged all businesses in the construction industry not to undermine the benefits of training, and to continue to reskill and upgrade themselves and their workers.

‘Rekening Valas’ offers easy way to improve your finances | Bahasa,13 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Rekening_Valas_offers_easy_way_to_improve_your_finances, Indonesia ,"- The world is entering a period of new normal. However, the economic challenges often haunt many countries, including Indonesia. Managing your finances effectively is the right strategy to achieve economic stability in every situation. One key strategy is to not keep your eggs in one basket but to diversify your investment portfolio by placing funds in different instruments and different currencies, including by saving your money in a forex account. This is done to take advantage of the opportunities available while exercising prudence. An analysis made by the DBS team and data from Bloomberg Finance show that during the Covid-19-triggered global financial market shocks in the first quarter of 2020, the Indonesia Composite Index (ICI) corrected by more than 30% in March. The correction was caused by investor panic over the spread of Covid-19 around the world. As a result, most of the stock prices on the Indonesia Stock Exchange collapsed. However, the US dollar strengthened by more than 15% against the rupiah in the same period, to the benefit of people who saved in US dollars. Therefore, saving in foreign currencies or opening a forex savings account is an attractive option. However, you should not buy foreign currencies carelessly. You can minimize the risk by saving your foreign currencies through a safe and reliable bank or official finance institution. Understanding people’s need for forex savings, digibank by DBS has recently launched its latest feature, ‘Rekening Valas’, which enables customers to manage foreign currency savings in 10 different currencies using a single application. With competitive exchange rates, ‘Rekening Valas’ is available in a number of currencies, including the USD, SGD, AUD, NZD, EUR, GBP, JPY, HKD, CAD, and CHF. In addition to being accessible anytime and anywhere, 24 hours a day, ‘Rekening Valas’ does not charge account administration fee or conversion fee. “Financial stability is important in every situation and we see this can be achieved through democratizing financial services to enable people to manage their finances easily and quickly. In line with this viewpoint, we believe that banking matters should not be a hassle for customers, especially in the current situation. Therefore, Bank DBS Indonesia through digibank by DBS continues to innovate to offer customer convenience through our comprehensive and practical digital banking services. As a pioneer of digital banking in Indonesia, we want to convince people that with digibank, everyone can (#SemuaPastiBisa) manage and develop their finances safely and comfortably,” said Managing Director, Head of Digital Banking, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, Leonardo Koesmanto . The ‘Rekening Valas’ feature can be accessed by Indonesians who have digibank by DBS accounts. Opening an account is also very easy as it is a completely branchless, paperless and signatureless process, thanks to banking digitization. By using the digibank by DBS application and making appointments through the application to leverage data, people can now open digibank by DBS accounts and enjoy complete digital banking services, from daily banking transactions to investments. “In times like these, you should not measure your investment solely by its returns but also by the risk. As investors, we must also look at the risks inherent in an investment instrument. We must also consider the liquidity factor. Foreign currency savings meet the criteria because they are highly liquid and can become an emergency fund. The risk is quite low as it follows the development of the money market. However, it should be noted that saving money should not be done recklessly to prevent losses. Saving your foreign currencies in digital banking institutions are the right way to do because security is guaranteed and access is open 24 hours a day without the need to go to a branch office,"" said Big Alpha CEO Tirta Prayudha.  In accordance with the principle of democratizing financial services, digibank by DBS through the #AllPastiBisa campaign has completed two new features, namely ‘Rekening Valas’ (Multi Currency Account) and Secondary Market Bonds. The two features allow people to move forward and improve their financial condition with digibank by DBS. Today, customers have more flexibility in investing their money thanks to a wide selection of product choices that can be accessed anytime and anywhere to help customers manage and develop their emergency funds in the new normal.

This also gives us an added avenue to explore cross-sell opportunities to grow our franchise by providing value-added services from other parts of the bank through our platform.” In testament to the success of DBSV’s digital trading platform, the monthly average of new accounts opened more than tripled in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period last year. Since 2017, all customer accounts onboarded to DBSV’s digital trading platform have already been multi-currency enabled. Internally, DBSV enhanced its digital infrastructure to facilitate nimble collaboration between trading desks and support units. Despite the spike in trading volumes amid a more volatile market environment, DBSV’s 1H2020 income almost doubled year-on-year, even as majority of employees worked from home. Greater coordination between the various functions in the bank, including capital markets, treasury and markets, institutional banking and private banking, also strengthened the brokerage’s business resiliency amid the crisis by enabling successful deal distribution remotely. For instance, though travel restrictions were in force across the globe, DBSV continued to actively engage investors through virtual roadshows, and registered a 25% increase in investor roadshows year-to-date as compared with the same period last year. “Ironically, the travel restrictions have broadened our investors’ reach across the globe as more institutional clients accept virtual meetings as the new way of work. In fact, we have been able to double the number of meetings with our clients from the US and UK in the past few months compared to the same period last year. Time zones are also no longer an issue with technology, and we have been able to organise multiple meetings with different investors in various countries in just one day, enabling us to close the books for roadshows more efficiently,” explained Lim. Looking ahead, DBSV sees opportunities in Asia’s burgeoning capital markets and will be focusing on rolling out new digital products to tap rising interest in passive trading and expanding its online access to more markets globally. “We need to continually pivot to stay ahead of changes and ensure that we stay future-ready to address our clients’ needs amid a constantly evolving capital markets landscape. This will help set us apart as a leader in Asia’s capital markets,” Lim said. Building on DBS Bank’s collaborative ecosystem  DBS Vickers will continue to build on efforts to unlock synergies across the various functions of DBS Bank to develop a well-oiled collaborative ecosystem. In particular, Lim shared that the collaborative approach with DBS’ capital markets group has been integral to the success of DBSV’s growth over the years. This has enabled the brokerage to act swiftly on business opportunities such as share buybacks and private placements, enhancing the value proposition it offers to customers. “With strong backing from DBS’ capital markets group, we have been able to provide our institutional clients with unrivalled access to some of the largest IPOs and secondary placements, along with timely market information. Conversely, we provide the extensive investor distribution network for the securities that are brought to market by DBS. This collaboration has undoubtedly helped us compete on the global stage and drive value for our clients,” said Lim. DBS’ capital markets group remains in pole position in Singapore’s equity space, leading all Main Board IPOs and participating in 93% of all equity funds raised on the Singapore Exchange in 2019. DBS’ strong branding and recognition as one of Asia’s safest banks also positions DBSV well when targeting investors in core markets, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, UK and US. Its overseas franchise, DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand), is among the leading securities companies in the country with a full securities licence since 1998. To enhance its leadership in the market, it partnered with DBS Private Bank last September to target Thailand’s growing pool of high net-worth individuals who increasingly seek investment opportunities overseas. The partnership is expected to double the bank’s wealth assets under management in Thailand from SGD 4 billion to SGD 8 billion by 2023. “Ultimately, we see ourselves as enablers within the entire DBS ecosystem, bridging our extensive investor base to DBS Bank clients, while strengthening competencies to increase market share, as in the case of Thailand. The aim for DBS Vickers is to differentiate ourselves with a powerful digital offering, while strengthening our investor network for DBS’ equity capital markets business,” said Lim.

"New normal, Indonesia optimistic about economic growth | Bahasa",11 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/New_normal_Indonesia_optimistic_about_economic_growth, Indonesia ,"- The Covid-19 pandemic has not shown any signs of abating anytime soon. The number of positive cases has until July 2020 continued to increase each day. However, the government decided to implement a new policy to adapt to new habits or new normal to support national economic recovery. To support the shift to the new normal, the Ministry of Finance has increased the budget allocation for Covid-19 handling, from Rp677.2 trillion to Rp695.2 trillion, to help drive the economy, particularly during the new normal phase, Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati said at the launch of the Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) in June 2020. The additional budget for Covid-19 handling will cover health costs (Rp87.55 trillion), social protection (Rp203.9 trillion), business incentives (Rp120.61 trillion), MSME assistance (Rp123.46 trillion), corporate financing (Rp537.57 trillion), and ministries/institutions and local governments (Rp106.11 trillion). Director of Center for Macroeconomic Policy, Fiscal Policy Agency, Ministry of Finance Hidayat Amir said in an online discussion with the media on 17 June that the figures were temporary and that the final figures would be incorporated into the revised Presidential Regulation Number 54/2020. Previously, in early June 2020, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said in an online discussion with the media that the government planned to increase the amount of stimulus for the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy to Rp720 trillion. The decision to increase the budget allocation for Covid-19 handling was made in the wake of unfavorable forecasts of the global economy due the Covid-19 pandemic. In a video conference entitled “Bill on 2021 State Budget Posture” on 23 July, President Joko Widodo said that he contacted several institutions related to the global economic forecasts, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which predicted that Indonesia’s economy would grow minus 6 percent to minus 7.6 percent while the World Bank predicted a negative growth of minus 5 percent. Apart from the OECD and the World Bank. the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its report entitled “World Economic Outlook Update: A Crisis Like No Other, An Uncertain Recovery” cut Indonesia’s economic growth projection to minus 0.3 percent. However, Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Governor Destry Damayanti said in an online discussion titled “Do we need ‘Helicopter Money’ during the Covid-19 crisis?” on 25 June that BI was still confident that the national economy would show a positive growth. Destry said that the central bank had no plans to revise its 2020 economic growth forecast, at 0.9 percent to 1.9 percent. On a similar note, the “DBS Chief Investment Office (CIO) Insights” projected that Indonesia’s economy will recover quickly after the pandemic. The “DBS CIO Insights” said in its analysis that the Indonesian and Singaporean markets are the most prospective in Southeast Asia in the new normal phase. “DBS CIO Insights” for the third quarter of 2020 said that Asian economies - excluding Japan – will recover the fastest post-Covid-19 pandemic thanks to the relatively good handling of the pandemic. In Asia, the report recommends China and Singapore. DBS also adds that Indonesia will benefit from the demographic factor because of the large young working-age population involved in digital economy. Meanwhile, in ASEAN, DBS recommends Indonesia and Singapore. The report also says that DBS believes that Indonesia will soon return to normalcy after the government’s policies on restrictions are lifted. In essence, Indonesia is an independent country with a population of young workers and domestic consumption that can accelerate economic recovery. Besides benefiting from the young working-age population, Destry said Indonesia has other advantages, namely the country's quite strong domestic economy. This advantage is not shared by other countries that according to the IMF will see negative growth. Destry added that from a financial point of view, Indonesia's investment returns are still attractive to foreign investors. “CIO Insights” 3Q20 also appreciates Bank Indonesia and the Indonesian government for providing support through key rate cuts and stimulus package for economic recovery.

DBS committed to joining forces with social enterprises through various support programmes amid Covid-19 pandemic | Bahasa,06 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_committed_to_joining_forces_with_social_enterprises_through_various_support_programmes_amid_Covid19_pandemic, Indonesia ,"- Recognising the important role social enterprises (SEs) play in creating positive impacts in society, whether by hiring disadvantaged people or solving social problems, DBS has taken a slew of proactive measures to beef up support for this sector. The support includes access to grants, increased mentoring or training to facilitate business development, such as digital transformation courses and a business resource guide for SEs. In addition, Bank DBS Indonesia supports social enterprises through the Business Transformation and Improvement (BTI) Grant programme. “We are aware that many social enterprises in Indonesia have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, making it difficult for them to run their business and to pursue their social mission. Being a bank that is driven by a sustainable goal, we continue to innovate to become a bank that promotes economic, social and environmental sustainability. We hope that the various initiatives we undertake can inspire other parties to develop social enterprises that also provides a social impact including the environment,” said PT Bank DBS Indonesia President Director Paulus Sutisna . DBS Foundation realised its commitment to joining forces with social enterprises through a special grant programme worth a total of SGD500,000 for social enterprises that are capable of developing and transforming businesses in Southeast Asia named DBS Foundation's BTI Grant programme. The programme aims to provide financial support for social enterprises so that they can maintain and create jobs as well as transform digitally in finding new sources of income to transform their business operations, which ultimately empowers them to continue serving the beneficiaries and the general public. “We believe that social enterprises are the future of business.

Furthermore, Bank DBS Indonesia continues to maintain and advance the social enterprises industry amid the Covid-19 pandemic through the BTI Grant DBS Foundation,” said Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, Mona Monika. The funding programme is open for 60 social enterprises that are supported by DBS Foundation across Asia, and is an additional funding outside the annual Social Enterprise Grant (SE Grant). DBS Foundation has awarded more than SGD5 million in grants to more than 100 social enterprises in the last five years. “Not only providing grants, Bank DBS supports us with its networks and skills to help us create a business system with guidance and a lot of amazing programmes we can attend to improve our capacity, both as organisations and individuals,” said Mycotech Co-founder Ronaldiaz Hartantyo. Apart from funding, social enterprises also have the opportunity to take part in other DBS Foundation’s programmes, including access to free webinars that are jointly organised with Indonesia’s Social Enterprise Platform (PLUS) by inviting experts in the field of social business. The activity, titled ""Social Enterprise Meet Up Online”, aims to educate and improve the skills of social enterprises. In addition, DBS is also committed to providing assistance and intensive training (skill-based volunteering) for social enterprises through a mentoring programme with DBS employees who are experts in their fields. The five-month programme underlines DBS Bank's commitment to providing support for social enterprises especially amid a pandemic.

First-half net profit declines 26% or SGD 0.84 billion to SGD 2.41 billion as general allowances of SGD 1.26 billion conservatively set aside,06 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/First_half_net_profit_declines_26pct_or_SGD_0_84_billion_to_SGD_2_41_billion_as_general_allowances_of_SGD_1_26_billion_conservatively_set_aside," Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, China, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group reported first-half 2020 net profit of SGD 2.41 billion, 26% lower than a year ago. Total allowances increased five-fold to SGD 1.94 billion as general allowances of SGD 1.26 billion were conservatively set aside to fortify the balance sheet against risks arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. The charge increased the amount of general allowance reserves by 50% to SGD 3.80 billion, 24% above the minimum requirement set by the MAS. Total allowance reserves rose to SGD 6.72 billion, which exceeded non-performing assets and boosted allowance coverage to 106% and to 199% when collateral was considered. Profit before allowances increased 12% to a record SGD 4.71 billion. Total income rose 7% to SGD 7.75 billion while expenses were stable. Net interest income increased 1% to SGD 4.79 billion as loan and deposit growth were offset by lower interest rates. Fee income rose 1% to SGD 1.51 billion with growth in the first quarter offset by a decline in the second quarter. Other non-interest income increased 42% to SGD 1.45 billion led by gains on fixed-income investments. Expenses were stable at SGD 3.04 billion. The positive jaw of seven percentage points lowered the cost-income ratio from 42% to 39%. Capital remained healthy with the Common Equity Tier-1 ratio at 13.7%. Net interest income First-half net interest income increased 1% from a year ago to SGD 4.79 billion. While loans grew over the first and second quarters, a lower net interest margin in the second quarter more than offset the impact of the higher loan volumes. As a result, net interest income swung from a 7% increase in the first quarter to a decline of 5% in the second quarter. Loans grew 5% or SGD 19 billion in constant-currency terms from a year ago to SGD 375 billion. Three percentage points or SGD 12 billion of the growth occurred in first-half 2020. Non-trade corporate loans expanded SGD 20 billion in the first half led by drawdowns in Singapore and Hong Kong. DBS participated actively in Singapore’s credit relief programmes in which the government provided a 90% risk share of loans. The growth in non-trade corporate loans was moderated by declines in trade loans, which fell SGD 5 billion, and consumer loans, which fell SGD 3 billion due to lower wealth management borrowing. While a majority of the decline in trade loans and consumer loans occurred in the first quarter, non-trade corporate loan growth was evenly paced over the two quarters. Non-trade corporate loan growth is expected to revert to previous-period levels in the second half. Higher deposit volumes also had a positive impact on net interest income. Deposits grew 13% or SGD 49 billion in constant-currency terms from a year ago to SGD 447 billion. SGD 36 billion of the increase occurred in first-half 2020 as current and savings accounts rose by a record SGD 54 billion, enabling higher-cost fixed deposits to be run off. The proportion of current and savings accounts rose seven percentage points from a year ago to 66%. First-half net interest margin fell 16 basis points from a year ago and 14 basis points from the previous half to 1.74%, with the first quarter at 1.86% and the second quarter at 1.62%. The decline in the second quarter was due to sharp cuts in interest rates as central banks globally responded to the pandemic and to the deployment of excess deposits into lower-yielding assets. Compared to the previous half, first-half net interest income was 2% lower. Fee income First-half fee income increased 1% to SGD 1.51 billion. A 14% growth in the first quarter was offset by an 11% decline in the second quarter as regional lockdowns resulted in lower activity. First-half wealth management fees grew 9% to SGD 707 million as record investment product sales in the first quarter were moderated by lower bancassurance sales. Loan-related fees increased 10% to SGD 226 million due to a higher number of transactions in the first quarter. Brokerage fees increased 25% to SGD 74 million from higher equity market volumes during the half year. Credit cards fees fell 21% to SGD 304 million as transactions fell with lower consumer spending from March. Investment banking fees declined 19% to SGD 63 million due to weaker market conditions. Transaction service fees were stable at SGD 374 million. Compared to the previous half, first-half fee income was 3% lower. Other non-interest income First-half other non-interest income increased 42% to SGD 1.45 billion. Trading income fell 6% to SGD 752 million as a decline in the first quarter due to wider credit spreads was moderated by an increase in the second quarter. Treasury customer income was higher in both quarters. Net gains on investment securities increased almost three times to SGD 663 million as profits were realised on fixed income portfolios which appreciated with lower interest rates. Compared to the previous half, first-half other income was 72% higher. Expenses First-half expenses were stable at SGD 3.04 billion. Staff costs rose 2% as higher base salary costs from an increased headcount were moderated by lower bonus accruals and by government grants. Non-staff costs were 3% lower as general expenses such as for travel and advertising declined. The positive jaw of seven percentage points reduced the cost-income ratio by three percentage points to 39%. Compared to the previous half, first-half expenses fell 5% led by lower non-staff costs. Business unit performance For the first half, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income declined 3% from a year ago to SGD 3.08 billion. Lower contributions from deposits and cards more than offset increased investment product and loan income. Institutional Banking income fell 1% to SGD 3.01 billion as a decline in cash management income due to lower interest rates more than offset the benefit of higher loan volumes and treasury product sales. Treasury Markets income increased 44% to SGD 714 million due to a strong trading performance. Income from the “Others” segment rose 69% to SGD 949 million, reflecting gains on investment securities managed by Corporate Treasury. Balance sheet Non-performing assets rose 10% to SGD 6.35 billion in the first half as new NPA formation was moderated by write-offs and recoveries. Most of the new NPA occurred in the first quarter, which included a significant oil trader exposure. The NPL rate was 1.5%, below the 1.6% in March and unchanged from the previous half. First-half total allowances increased almost five-fold from a year ago to SGD 1.94 billion. Two-thirds or SGD 1.26 billion of the amount was for general allowances set aside to fortify the balance sheet. Specific allowances nearly doubled to SGD 672 million or 30 basis points of loans, with the increase due to the significant exposure in the first quarter. Total allowance reserves increased 25% to SGD 6.72 billion and allowance coverage was at 106%. When collateral valued at SGD 2.97 billion was considered, allowance coverage was at 199%. Liquidity remained ample as the franchise benefited from flight-to-quality inflows. Deposits grew 9% or SGD 36 billion in constant-currency terms in the first half to SGD 447 billion. The loan-deposit ratio fell five percentage points to 84%. The liquidity coverage ratio of 134% and the net stable funding ratio of 121% were both above regulatory requirements of 100%. Capital continued to be healthy. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio declined from 14.1% from December 2019 to 13.7% as risk weighted assets increased from loan growth, credit exposures on derivatives, and market risk. The leverage ratio of 6.8% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%. In line with MAS’ guidance for local banks to moderate their dividends for 2020, the Board declared a dividend of SGD 18 cents per share for the second quarter, for which the scrip dividend scheme will be applicable. Scrip dividends will be issued at the average of the closing share prices on 14 and 17 August 2020. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “The strong operating performance we reported amidst severe macroeconomic headwinds in the first half attests to the resilience of our franchise. Our solid balance sheet was further fortified by a significant increase in allowance reserves, strong liquidity inflows and healthy earnings. Notwithstanding the uncertainties, we are in a good position to continue supporting customers and the community through the difficult months ahead of us.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS supports IRAS in digital payment implementation,04 Aug 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_supports_IRAS_in_digital_payment_implementation, Singapore ,"- As part of the nation’s drive to adopt digital contact-free payments, DBS Bank has been collaborating with government agencies such as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) to integrate APIs (application programming interface) into the tax authority’s operating framework to digitalise payments. DBS employee Patricia Loh making payment for her income tax via the newly launched PayNow QR option. IRAS now offers PayNow QR as a payment option on its myTax portal for all major tax types, including Individual Income Tax, Corporate Income Tax, Property Tax and Goods and Services Tax, to provide greater convenience for both individual and corporate taxpayers. Currently, these tax types comprise more than 80% of IRAS’ total tax collections, with a taxpayer base of more than three million individuals and businesses. With PayNow QR implemented, taxpayers can enjoy a more seamless and convenient experience when making tax payments. To pay by PayNow QR, all they need to do now is to use their SingPass/CorpPass to log into IRAS’ myTax portal, scan the PayNow QR code with any of the digital banking mobile apps from the nine participating PayNow banks, and complete the payment in real-time. Apart from the convenience of the scan and pay function via IRAS’ myTax portal, taxpayers can also benefit from instant settlement and real-time status updates of their outstanding tax balance. Mr Raof Latiff, Group Head of Digital, Institutional Banking, DBS Bank, said, “Singapore continues to make steady headway in fulfilling its ambition to become a digital payments society with statutory boards such as IRAS taking the lead to implement secure and instant payment solutions that provide greater convenience to individual and corporate taxpayers. The QR code has become increasingly ubiquitous and we look forward to supporting IRAS in continued efforts to enhance their customer payment journey and drive broader adoption of QR payments locally.” Ms Ang Sor Tjing, Director of IRAS’ Revenue and Payment Management Branch, said, “IRAS firmly believes in leveraging technology to redefine our taxpayers’ experience. By partnering with banks to push out different digital payment methods, IRAS hopes to offer taxpayers a wider variety of payment options so as to cater to each taxpayer’s unique needs, preferences and circumstances, and as such encourage prompt tax payment.” Some DBS employees have also taken the opportunity to make payment for their income tax through IRAS’ new PayNow QR option.“I have always opted to pay for my income tax via digital means because of the convenience it brings about as I’m always on the go. Last year, I used the bank transfer option which required me to key in my Tax Reference number. But with PayNow QR, the process is now truly seamless with the scan and pay option, making my taxpaying experience even more convenient than before. I’m definitely going to opt for this going forward and will encourage my friends and family to do so too,” shared Ms Patricia Loh, Associate at DBS Bank. DBS and IRAS have been working together over the last two years to digitalise payments across the tax authority’s various tax types. With the support of DBS, IRAS first introduced PayNow as an option for businesses to receive Wage Credit Scheme [1] (WCS) payouts in March 2019. Before the implementation of PayNow, about half of WCS-eligible businesses, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), received their payouts via cheques. For the next phase, both parties are collaborating to introduce PayNow QR for stamp duty payments in 2021. Latiff says, “We are here with our customers for the long haul and see ourselves as more than just a bank, but as a tech solutions provider as well. While it may be easy to take the old pipes and replace them with new ones, what is more relevant is how we can help companies transform to provide effective solutions that are not only more efficient, but also provide a better customer experience.” DBS continues to see a steady increase in individuals and corporates adopting PayNow as a payment solution, with the bank holding close to 40% of the market share by registration to date. DBS’ corporate clients contribute around half of the PayNow Corporate receipts in Singapore. To help corporate customers transition to digital ways of work, DBS has carried out more than 50 online webinars to date, engaging close to 1,000 corporate customers.

DBS’ new solutions will help customers and their Wealth Planning Managers identify and address any blind spots or gaps in their retirement planning lifecycle, whether a customer is accumulating assets or moving into the decumulation phase [1] . According to DBS’ data, a third of DBS’ customers presently have negative cash flow. While most DBS customers know when they want to retire, they are less certain about how long their nest egg will last. They also do not know how to supplement their cash and CPF savings with investments. Jeremy Soo, Head, Consumer Banking Group, DBS Singapore , said: “During these uncertain times when people are worried about declining incomes and outliving their savings, DBS has an even greater responsibility to extend our expertise in managing money and simplifying retirement planning for Singaporeans. Coupled with our partnership with CPF, we are offering Singaporeans an industry-first holistic retirement proposition that provides greater clarity around their financial future based on the assets they have, including those held under government schemes such as CPF and the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS). This unparalleled access to insights and resources will enable Singaporeans to make more informed investment decisions that will strengthen their financial resilience during their golden years and protect the financial health of their loved ones.” Irene Kang, Group Director (Communications), CPF Board , said: “CPF is an important foundation of retirement for many Singaporeans. We congratulate DBS for taking the initiative to make retirement planning more accessible to everyone, and we welcome similar collaborations with other financial institutions.” “Map Your Money” With the “Map Your Money” function, integrated within DBS’ digital advisory tool NAV Planner [2] , DBS customers can now plan for their golden years. The function, which will be progressively rolled out from 2 August, pulls together customers’ existing assets held within and outside DBS, and projects their future income based on pre-defined assumptions, so they can better visualise their future cashflow situation via an integrated chart. “Map Your Money” also integrates baseline CPF and SRS rules to provide a hassle-free experience for customers when assessing their financial future. They can then choose from a menu of investment solutions, designed to be accessible to all, to boost their investment portfolios.   The “Map Your Money” function in NAV Planner pulls together customers’ existing  assets and projects their future income, so they can better visualise their future  cashflow situation via an integrated chart DBS is also using facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence to help users better visualise their retirement future. Dubbed “Face your Future”, the tool, which will be launched this month, taps on algorithms to estimate a customer’s retirement needs based on his or her lifestyle choices and even creates a photographic portrait of how the customer looks at retirement age.   Evy Wee, Head of Financial Planning and Personal Investing , DBS Singapore, said: “We’ve found that many procrastinate on retirement planning because the different rules, calculations and information required to get started can often be intimidating. Our retirement solutions aim to simplify a complex journey. For Map your Money, customers simply need to indicate their retirement aims, and the tool does the rest of the work – automatically taking into consideration varied factors such as cashflows, income, lifespan, CPF, SRS rules and schemes – to provide the requisite retirement projections and insights. There is no magic number that customers need to set aside. All they need is to ensure they have sufficient money to fund their desired quality of life after they retire, and our solutions easily map the way forward for them.”   DBS Retirement Planning Portal  DBS is launching a new virtual Retirement Planning Portal (go.dbs.com/retirement) on 8 August for customers who are keen to safeguard the financial security of their loved ones but may not have the necessary knowledge or skills to ensure that their estate will be properly handled after their deaths. The portal tackles the common challenges faced by customers in understanding estate planning and aggregates relevant resources within a single portal, making it easier for customers to find the information they need and seek help. The retirement portal, which will launch on 8 August, enables customers to better understand estate planning as it aggregates relevant resources within a single portal For a start, the portal will offer services, provided by DBS’ partners, that allow customers to: 1. Access CPF nominations online quickly: To date, 57% of CPF members, who are eligible to make nominations, have not done so. 2. Make wills: The benefit of writing a Will is to ensure that assets are distributed according to the wishes of the deceased and avoid a lengthy and potentially costly probate process. Only an estimated one in 10 people in Singapore has written a will. 3. Apply for Lasting Power of Attorney: Against the backdrop of Singapore’s ageing population, customers might want to understand how to get someone to make decisions on their behalf if they become mentally incapacitated by applying for an LPA. About 67,000 people have appointed someone to make decisions on their behalf if they become mentally incapacitated [3] . 4. Arrange for a Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) care plan: This is to ensure that those with special needs will be well taken care of by a personalised care plan. SNTC is the only non-profit trust company in Singapore to provide affordable trust services to persons with special needs. While it is estimated that 3% of the Singapore population, between 18 and 49, have disabilities [4] , SNTC’s social work-trained case managers have worked with caregivers to develop only 3,000 care plans for their dependents with special needs. Customers can access financial planning information through NAV Planner, or consult DBS’ Wealth Planning Managers via the bank’s virtual TeleAdvisory consultation service. Since NAV Planner’s launch in April this year, more than one million users have used the digital advisory platform to do budgeting and monitor their investment performance, as well as obtain personalised financial insights and recommendations. __________________ [1] The decumulation phase is when customers begin to convert their savings, investments and other retirement benefits into sustainable income that can fund their needs and wants after the paychecks stop.

"Launches its new features, digibank by DBS encourages customers to adopt new investment habits | Bahasa",29 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Launches_its_new_features_digibank_by_DBS_encourages_customers_to_adopt_new_investment_habits, Indonesia ,"- digibank by DBS, a pioneer in digital banking in Indonesia, today launched its newest features, Multi Currency Accounts and Secondary Market Bonds. The launch of these features further confirmed its commitment to realising the intelligent way of banking by continuously enriching its features to provide complete, integrated, easy and safe financial services so that customers can enjoy life more in accordance with Bank DBS Indonesia’s Live more, Bank less mission. The two new features of digibank by DBS give customers more choices in managing their finances and encourage them to invest as well. Considering the large number of investment instruments available, digibank by DBS makes it easier for customers to choose safe, low-risk, and liquid investments so that they can be used as emergency funds. In the current new normal, managing and developing finances to prepare for all possibilities in the future has become increasingly important. According to Ministry of Manpower data as of June 2020, three million workers in all sectors have been laid off. The layoffs are one of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and certainly affect the stability of national and public finances. Therefore, customers need to review their financial management to prepare for an uncertain future. ""It is important for people to follow the health protocols to stay healthy and productive. In addition, adjustments to the new normal include better financial management to prepare for all possibilities in the future so that economic activity can continue,"" said Covid-19 Task Force Spokesperson dr. Reisa Broto Asmoro who attended the launch of the latest features of digibank by DBS. “We are aware of the role of digital banking, in this case digibank by DBS, in opening easy, fast, and secure financial access. Through the #SemuaPastiBisa campaign, everyone has equal opportunity to access financial services needed to set up an emergency fund, even further developing it with a process that is 100% digital from end-to-end. Therefore, we launch two new features, Multi Currency Accounts and Secondary Market Bonds, that fit customer needs in the new normal,"" said PT Bank DBS Indonesia Managing Director, Head of Digital Banking Leonardo Koesmanto. Multi Currency Account and Secondary Market Bonds enable customers to expand their investment through instruments to suit their needs. Using the Multi Currency Account feature, customer can save in 10 different currencies, namely USD, SGD, AUD, EUR, HKD, CAD, GBP, NZD, JPY, and CHF, in a single account and manage their fund well as the exchange and interest rates are competitive. The feature is also suitable for foreign currency transactions, enables investors to anticipate exchange rate fluctuations and to diversify investment portfolios to mitigate risks. Meanwhile, the Secondary Market Bonds feature allows customers to invest in the secondary market starting from Rp1 million, making it affordable for customers who want to start investing and to set up an emergency fund. Previously, the secondary market was only accessible to investors with substantial capital. To date, digibank by DBS is the only digital banking that provides various investment options starting from just Rp1 million. Customers need only to make a Single Investor Identification (SID) to purchase and sell bonds using the digibank by DBS app. “Currently, there are many investment instrument options that can function as emergency funds, ranging from low- to high-risk, to affordable investments with minimum fund. Our new feature has an advantage of high flexibility and liquidity that can benefit customers in managing, developing, and using their funds. Therefore, digibank by DBS encourages and facilitates customers to invest to develop their finances,” said PT Bank DBS Indonesia Head of Advisory and Digital Investment Djoko Soelistyo. digibank by DBS promotes the democratisation of finance through the new features that enable every person to move forward and improve their financial situation. Therefore, customers will be more flexible in investing using various product options that can be accessed easily, safely, comfortably, and affordably to manage and develop their emergency funds in the new normal.

DBS and GovTech to pilot SingPass face verification technology for faster digital banking sign-ups,29 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_GovTech_to_pilot_SingPass_face_verification_technology_for_faster_digital_banking_sign_ups, Singapore ,"- Observing a rise in digital banking in Singapore amid Covid-19, DBS – which banks most of Singapore – has partnered with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to pilot the latter’s innovative SingPass Face Verification technology. This pilot programme aims to benefit more than one million DBS customers who are SingPass holders and do not use digital banking services, of which over 60% are seniors aged 62 and above. The technology will enable Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents to sign up for DBS’ digital banking services from their homes, with instant access to their bank accounts and banking services. For DBS customers unfamiliar with online onboarding, the SingPass Face Verification feature is designed to help expedite their digital banking registration process in a more intuitive and seamless manner. “Amid one of the greatest disruptions ever witnessed in our time, we are more cognisant than ever about the importance of leveraging digital technology to quickly serve up solutions that benefit the wider public,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS Bank. “In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation agenda, we have been introducing innovative digital solutions over the years that provide easier, more seamless ways to bank. Together with GovTech Singapore, we aim to support those who are journeying into digital banking for the first time, and to help foster resilient digital habits that will last for years to come.” Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, “We are delighted to partner leading digital bank DBS in piloting SingPass face verification for simpler customer journeys. As our Smart Nation digital identity, SingPass enables citizens to transact seamlessly with public and private sector services, accelerating digitalisation and strengthening trust in our digital economy. We look forward to building more impactful services with the financial sector and beyond, to bring greater convenience to our citizens.” How it works SingPass, Singapore’s national digital identity, has rolled out its latest face verification feature which offers a trusted and convenient mode of identity verification. Businesses match the user’s presented facial image against the Government’s biometric database, and do not collect nor retain any data submitted. This helps ensure the user’s data privacy and security. DBS/POSB customers who are keen to sign up for DBS/POSB digibank via the SingPass Face Verification may download the digibank mobile app via Apple App Store, Google Play or Huawei App Gallery. To begin the registration process, customers need to select the identity type and enter the corresponding information. They should then select the “SingPass Face Verification” option and follow the instructions to take the selfie. The tool will scan the user’s face, which will be matched against their latest NRIC/Passport photo records from the Government’s biometric database instantly. Upon successful matching, DBS will send an SMS-OTP to the user’s registered mobile number for verification, after which the user may create his/her preferred digibank credentials. Users should not disclose their personal details to others, including digibank credentials.  In July 2020, DBS conducted a beta trial of the SingPass Face Verification technology with over 100 seniors and students from ITE College West. The trial concluded to positive response among the participants. The majority of participants said they would recommend that their family and friends use the SingPass Face Verification option to sign up for digital banking or other banking services once available in future, as they find it much quicker and easier than existing digital banking sign-up methods that conventionally require them to have their card and PIN details on hand to complete the registration process. Said Nancy Yeo, 66 years old, “I didn’t sign up for a digital banking account as I wasn’t confident about completing the process, but this new face verification option helped me erase any doubts. The instructions were easy to understand and the process was surprisingly enjoyable, as it was just like taking a selfie photo with my grandchild on my smartphone! This definitely changed my view about online banking, that it really isn’t as complicated as I had thought.” Previously, customers who signed up for digital banking services online were required to use their ATM, credit or debit card and PIN to complete the verification process before they could access digital banking services for the first time. Those who did not have their card and PIN would have to wait up to five working days to receive their items by post to activate their digital banking accounts. Beyond the pilot programme, DBS customers will also have the option of using the SingPass Face Verification technology to sign up for other products and services by the end of 2020. The feature is also being piloted in view of significant consumer shifts towards digital services, coupled with the steady rise of mobile and smartphone usage among Singaporeans, where smartphone penetration is expected to reach 80 percent of the population by 2022 [1] . By the end of 2019, the bank noted that the number of customers who had been conducting their banking needs solely via mobile on the bank’s mobile banking app, DBS digibank, almost doubled from 2017 to 2019. Furthermore, close to one million DBS customers today are independent digital banking users, which means that they are active on the bank’s digital banking platforms, and have gone more than a year without visiting a bank branch or calling the bank’s contact centre for assistance. During Covid-19, more seniors have been turning to digital banking to meet their banking needs – the number of seniors who used digital banking in April and May 2020 more than tripled compared to the same period last year.

Data validation amid pandemic to support digital banking | Bahasa,27 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Data_validation_amid_pandemic_to_support_digital_banking, Indonesia ,"- Indonesia’s economy contracted in the second quarter of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The banking sector is expected to contribute to efforts to accelerate the nation’s economic recovery. As more and more activities require minimal physical contact, banks need to make adjustments to meet customer needs through massive digital transformation. Therefore, digital banking services are the best alternative for customers to conduct financial transactions. This needs to be supported with good data validation to protect customer data and prevent data manipulation or misuse. Recognizing the importance of accurate data validation, digibank by DBS, a pioneer of digital banking in Indonesia, collaborates with the Home Ministry’s Population and Civil Registration Directorate General to utilize population data to give secure and easy banking transaction experiences to customers. The collaboration is very helpful to digibank by DBS’ Electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC) process through verification of population data and electronic ID card (e-KTP). The technology will ensure a convenient and efficient process as it saves customers a trip to the branch office (branchless), does not use paper (paperless), and does not need wet signature (signatureless). “The security and confidentiality of customer data are the main priority of Bank DBS Indonesia. Therefore, we continue to develop customer data security technology, including through collaboration with the Population and Civil Registration Office (Dukcapil), and operate under the Financial Services Authority (OJK). The Dukcapil’s Go Digital program, which aims to support the government’s commitment to implementing the Single Identity Number (SIN), helps accelerate our digital transformation,” said PT Bank DBS Indonesia Managing Director, Head of Digital Banking Leonardo Koesmanto. To accelerate the implementation of SIN, the Dukcapil is standardizing the Citizen Identity Number (NIK). Currently, 99.04% of Indonesians have e-KTP as unique citizen data to support the One Data Policy. ""People should be aware of their personal data and public data kept at various institutions. If we search for 'KTP' in cyberspace, millions of e-KTP will be displayed. This needs serious attention from the public as well as related institutions. All institutions that use data should keep data secure and protect the personal data of all customers. There should be no data buying and selling, no use of data that is not in accordance with its designation to ensure compliance with the rule of law, and the protection of confidential personal data,"" said Director General of Population and Civil Registration Prof. Dr. Zudan Arif Fakrulloh, SH., M.H. As digital transformation is accelerating, the Dukcapil plays a central role in e-KYC by providing access to identity verification. This is done to protect the various sectors that engage in economic activities, such as banking, insurance and the trade industry, against fraud. With e-KYC based on Dukcapil data, document forgery in banking can be reduced and customer data is verified. During the pandemic, digibank by DBS has experienced a significant increase of up to 75% in the number of transactions. In view of the fact, DBS is becoming more active in developing features in its application, especially for wealth management, to facilitate customers in conducting financial management transactions. In the near future, digibank by DBS plans to launch the Multi-Currency Account and Secondary Bonds features to give customers more choices in saving their money and improving their finances. To support population data utilization in investment instruments and foreign exchange transactions, and given the increasingly diverse demands of digital banking, the Dukcapil is taking steps to complete the construction of population big data to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of public services.

"M+S secures SGD1.95 billion Green Loan for award winning Marina One from DBS, OCBC Bank and UOB",27 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/M_S_secures_SGD_1_95_billion_Green_Loan_for_award_winning_Marina_One_from_DBS_OCBC_Bank_and_UOB, Singapore ,"- M+S Pte. Ltd. (“M+S”), through its subsidiary MS Commercial Pte Ltd, has secured a SGD1.95 billion green loan for its prized sustainable asset Marina One. The integrated development was recently crowned the global winner of the sustainable development category at the prestigious 2020 FIABCI World Prix d'Excellence Awards. This is the largest green loan secured by a real estate company in Asia Pacific to date. DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank Limited (UOB) acted as Joint Green Loan Advisors and Mandated Lead Arrangers for this transaction. The proceeds of the green loan will be used to partially refinance the office and retail components of Marina One, which are valued at approximately SGD5 billion. Located in the new financial hub of Marina Bay, Marina One East and West Towers consist of 1.88 million square feet of Grade-A office space, including two high density floors that are cantilevered across both towers. It is home to industry leaders and multinationals such as Facebook, PwC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Julius Baer, Netflix, Rajah and Tann and Prudential. Marina One’s retail podium, known as The Heart, covers over 140,000 square feet across four floors with diverse retail, lifestyle and dining offerings. While Marina One also comprises two premium residential towers – Marina One Residences – the residential component is not part of the green loan package. Over 80% of the 1,042 luxury residences have already been sold to date, with high transaction volumes continuing to grab industry headlines despite Singapore’s Circuit Breaker and safe reopening restrictions. Marina One was conceived with sustainability at the heart of its architecture and operation. Designed by Christoph Ingenhoven from Ingenhoven Architects, a pioneering leader in sustainable architecture, the centrepiece of the development is a sprawling biodiversity garden coined the “Green Heart”, meant to be enjoyed as a civic space and which has become a green oasis within the financial district. Every facet of Marina One’s architecture serves to create environmental benefits – from building orientation to meandering louvres on its façade that provide each level with direct shade from the sun to reduce heat and cooling needs. A multitude of technology is also used to conserve energy and boost efficiency. These innovative measures include the recycling of heat and power, rainwater harvesting for irrigation purposes, energy saving building management systems, high performance solar glazing and the use of sustainable and energy efficient fittings and materials throughout the development. In addition to its recent win at the 2020 FIABCI World Prix d'Excellence Awards, Marina One has achieved numerous international accolades for its sustainable design and was notably awarded the Best Innovative Green Building at the MIPIM Awards 2018. It is LEED Platinum certified and has achieved the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Platinum rating, the highest rating in the scheme. Ms Kemmy Tan, Chief Executive Officer, M+S Pte. Ltd., said, “From the very conceptualisation of Marina One, we wanted this development to be a beacon of sustainability and a symbol of change in the evolution of Marina Bay. It is living proof that commercial real estate can, and should, embrace the principles of sustainability without compromising on design and quality. In fact, many of our business partners and community were drawn to Marina One precisely because of this focus on sustainability and the efforts taken to reduce the impact on the environment.” She added, “We are also proud to have banking partners who have supported us for many years and continue to stand behind the same sustainability values that we champion.” Mr Ang Teck Wee, Managing Director and Head of Government-Linked Corporations, DBS Bank, said, “As the world deals with some of the most pressing challenges of our time, more than ever, companies need to reassess how they are creating value for society. With purpose at the core of DBS’ approach to responsible banking, we are delighted to support M+S in their commitment to sustainable development, while harnessing technology to mitigate climate change. We hope that M+S’ largest green loan for a real estate company to-date in Asia Pacific will inspire and challenge more companies to incorporate sustainability into their corporate strategies for a resilient and relevant business for the future.” Ms Elaine Lam, Head, Global Corporate Banking, OCBC Bank, said, “We are honoured to support M+S on the green loan for its award-winning integrated development, Marina One. This landmark deal, being the largest real estate green loan in Asia Pacific, will bolster Singapore’s reputation in sustainable financing. Given the finite resources we have in our natural environment, it is vital that we create an urban landscape that is smart, healthy and sustainable. OCBC has set an ambitious sustainable finance target of SGD25 billion by 2025 and we look forward to partner our customers in a collective effort to build a more sustainable future together.” Mr Leong Yung Chee, Head of Corporate Banking Singapore, UOB, said, “At UOB, we work closely with our clients to drive sustainable development.

"DBS Hong Kong drives purposeful banking to reduce food waste, with the “Care more, Waste less” program | 繁體",23 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Hong_Kong_drives_purposeful_banking_to_reduce_food_waste__with_the_Care_more_Waste_less_program, Hong Kong ,"- With the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upending nearly every aspect of daily life, and disrupting supply chains, especially the food supply chain, there is growing concern that more food will be wasted in 2020 than ever before. To help reduce food waste, DBS Hong Kong is partnering with local charity Foodlink Foundation as part of a purpose-driven “Care more, Waste less” initiative, to help ensure surplus food reaches the underprivileged in the community instead of the landfill. DBS Hong Kong CEO Sebastian Paredes said, “The impact we create at DBS Hong Kong goes beyond banking, and reflects our core commitment to being purpose-driven. What we do touches real people, real businesses and real lives, to effect real change, especially when many people, including the most vulnerable, are struggling in these unprecedented and uncertain times.” “Amid the outbreak of COVID-19, there is an even greater need for food support for those who are most vulnerable to hunger. With DBS Hong Kong’s support, Foodlink will be able to help ease the burden on those who are facing job insecurities, as well as the many underprivileged, by providing daily food assistance. We are so grateful for DBS Hong Kong’s continued support during this challenging time,” Foodlink Foundation Executive Director Robin Hwang said. DBS Hong Kong is sponsoring a new refrigerated van that will be used by Foodlink Foundation to help collect safe-to-eat surplus food from F&B outlets all over the city and deliver it to the underprivileged. The aim is to rescue 14 tonnes of surplus food, which would provide about 34,000 meals for the underprivileged. DBS Hong Kong has also enlisted celebrity Danny So (細So), and his wife, Wing, and children, to help bring “Care more, Waste less” to life in the community, with the whole family spending a day helping Foodlink Foundation rescue and redistribute surplus food. Wing and other influencers will also showcase ways to transform ugly food, which is often thrown away because their appearance is not perfect, into delicious dishes. More details： go.dbs.com/3fQ3AIF To encourage everyone to reduce food waste, DBS Hong Kong is offering its credit card customers an InstaRedeem 20% off (Maximum deduction per transaction is HK$100 off) when shopping at GreenPrice, a social enterprise specialising in surplus and short-dated stock. In addition, DBS Hong Kong employees are encouraged to donate more than 8,000 cans of surplus food to Foodlink Foundation, for redistribution to the needy in the community. “Care more, Waste less” embodies DBS Hong Kong’s sense of purposeful banking, and paints a Portrait of Purpose of standing together with the community, and acting with courage, perseverance and generosity. DBS Hong Kong is driven to create these Portraits of Purpose, by working together to help feed the needy, and supporting businesses to fight another day, for a more sustainable future for generations to come.

"Everything you need to know about effective, safe and foolproof ways of managing your finances | Bahasa",23 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Everything_you_need_to_know_about_effective_safe_and_foolproof_ways_of_managing_your_finances, Indonesia ,"- Indonesians are entering the new normal amid economic uncertainty. Financial management has become a main priority to maintain a balance between income and expenses, including investment. Investment is often considered a complex matter and is only intended for people who work in the financial industry. Is it true? Of course not. Anyone can invest and achieve financial stability and independence. Investment is a financial concept that will help you achieve financial stability and even gain profit in the future. How to start? Let’s see the basic steps to begin investing that everyone can try! Set your financial goals Do you realise that without planning, everything we do is a waste of time? It often happens when we shop at a supermarket without a shopping list; we will end up with a lot of choices and impulsive buying. The same is true with financial planning; we must have goals and priorities that can be measured so that we can achieve our financial goals. Complicated? Not really. You can create a timeline for your financial goals: Short-term financial goals Short-term goals usually cover a period of one year to two years. For example, when making plans for a holiday, we should at least maintain enough money or set aside part of our income to cover the holiday costs in advance. Medium-term financial goals Medium-term financial goals cover a period of two to ten years. One example is setting up money for quality education for your children. Investment instruments for medium-term goals are different from short-term goals. Long-term financial goals Long-term financial goals usually cover a period of more than ten years. The risks could be bigger because we have a long time to anticipate all forms of uncertainty. One example is setting up a retirement fund. We must make proper retirement plans to avoid becoming a burden for our children and grandchildren in the future. Another example of long-term financial goals is education. The question is, how to start? Stash your money in low-risk investment instruments When you have set aside part of your income, the next step is to save it. You can stash your cash in low-risk investment instruments that don’t need substantial capital. There are a variety of investment instruments that start from a million rupiah. What are the low-risk investment instruments that can be the first step for your investment journey? Deposits Placing funds in deposits is more profitable than saving because deposits offer higher returns. Term deposits carry different maturities ranging from one month to twelve months. In the past, people assumed that opening a deposit account required a huge fund. However, today you can open a time deposit account starting from one million rupiah through the digibank by DBS application. The deposit feature allows digibank by DBS customers to make deposits anytime and anywhere. Currently, the interests offered are relatively higher compared to term deposits in general, namely 5.5% p.a. digibank by DBS deposits are also guaranteed by the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS). Bonds Bonds are similar to deposits because they are low-risk but offer relatively high returns. There are three types of products we can buy through digibank by DBS application, namely Retail Savings Bond (SBR), Indonesian Retail Bonds (ORI) and Sukuk Savings (ST). SBR, ORI and ST offer monthly coupon payments. You can buy all three products through the e-SBN feature at the time of the product's initial launch with an initial investment of one million rupiah. The e-SBN feature allows customers to invest in a 100% end-to-end digital process, from the registration of Single Investor Identification (SID) to the purchase and resale of tradable bonds. You don't have to go through a complicated process and investing in a banking platform is certainly safer. Secondary Market Bonds There are three types of bonds traded on the secondary market, namely FR, INDON and INDOIS. In the past, customers must have a large initial capital of at least one hundred million rupiah to enter the secondary market. However, today, customers can access the secondary market without having to prepare large funds. Through digibank by DBS, customers can start investing in the secondary market starting from one million rupiah. digibank by DBS is the first digital banking service that gives people fully digital access to the secondary market. Set up an emergency fund! An emergency fund is no less important when life is full of uncertainty. Without an emergency fund, we will have problems in an emergency. One concrete example is the Covid-19 pandemic that has caused economic uncertainty across the country. However, don't worry! You can manage your emergency fund by using appropriate investment instruments such as deposits and bond securities. You can access your deposits and bonds through the digibank by DBS application that allows you to manage your investment instruments easily and quickly without having to go to a branch office. Financial management using a variety of low-risk investment opportunities can not only function as an emergency fund but also to make a profit. Anyone can make an investment without having to go through complicated processes and without the need of large funds through digibank by DBS. ""People often consider banking activities, including financial management, complicated. The length of time required and the process that tends to be long are often considered as obstacles for everyone who wants to start their financial journey. However, a balanced financial management is the key to individual economic freedom and stability. Bank DBS Indonesia realises the role of technology in removing these obstacles and helping customers achieve their financial goals. Today, anyone can make an investment without having to go through a complicated process and without having to set aside a large fund through digibank by DBS,"" said PT Bank DBS Indonesia Managing Director, Head of Digital Banking Leonardo Koesmanto. Currently, DBS is holding the #SemuaPastiBisa campaign to encourage people to manage and develop their finances wisely using the digibank by DBS app. Customers can do all banking activities, such as opening an account, top up their e-wallet, pay monthly bills, transfer foreign exchange funds, open a deposit account, invest in the secondary market, and open a forex account with 10 currencies in one application.

Infor and DBS Bank partner to integrate digital trade financing into global supply chains,22 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Infor_and_DBS_Bank_partner_to_integrate_digital_trade_financing_into_global_supply_chains, Singapore ,"- Infor , a global leader in business cloud software specialised by industry, today announced that it is partnering with DBS Bank, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, to integrate digital trade financing capabilities into the Infor Nexus global network of more than 68,000 businesses. The two companies’ first joint program recently went live with one of the world’s largest global apparel companies, providing faster and more cost-efficient digital trade financing to suppliers in the apparel company’s supply chain ecosystem, which comprises mostly small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “This is an important relationship for Infor, where a common vision of data-driven financing bonds us and presses us forward,” said Gary Schneider, Vice President of Sales for Infor Financial Supply Chain Management. “DBS is a digital bank, based in Asia, focused on supplier funding and liquidity. Its pursuit of digital innovation and delivering greater value to supply chains, combined with our cloud-based platform and local support team around the globe, makes for a powerful partnership at a time when liquidity is a top priority for everyone.” Sriram Muthukrishnan, Group Head of Trade Product Management, DBS Bank, said, “We continue to accelerate the deployment of our market-leading supply chain financing and digital capabilities to ensure steady financing to SME suppliers during these times of stress. Data forms the backbone of a successful digital strategy and its impact across multiple industries globally has been growing exponentially.” “Our collaboration with Infor enables greater transparency into complex supply chains and provides insights into the transaction patterns between an anchor and its ecosystem of suppliers,” Muthukrishnan noted. “We leverage these insights to provide quicker and more cost-efficient financing to suppliers much earlier in the cycle, as compared to conventional post-shipment supplier financing programs. This is especially relevant today, as we continue to operate in an environment characterised by prolonged trade disruptions and tighter credit lines, where optimal working capital management is key to survival.” The two companies’ next joint program for pre-shipment finance, expected to launch in late 2020, will utilise supply chain data as the primary conduit to assess risk and credit worthiness, as opposed to traditional models that result in the majority of suppliers being under-funded or facing challenges to access necessary capital. Infor provides extensive supply chain data, including historic and real-time milestone information on the physical movement of goods, to enable a data-driven representation of a supplier’s performance and credit risk. According to a research report from Aite Group analyst Enrico Camerinelli (The Supply Chain Bank, 2018), “In the next three years, the competitive frontier in corporate lending and supply chain finance will be the creation of innovative credit risk models that banks will use to leverage corporate supply chain process data. Banks will capture and analyse events in the physical supply chain (source-to-pay, order-to-cash) in order to generate a more comprehensive and realistic representation of a company’s risk profile.” Additional Resources Watch the SCF Community’s recent webinar, “ New ways to finance SMEs ,” during which Infor and DBS discuss innovative supplier financing tools to help reduce supply chain risk and friction.

DBS readies Singapore's facilities management sector for digital transformation with industry's first digital collection solution,22 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_readies_Singapores_facilities_management_sector_for_digital_transformation_with_industrys_first_digital_collection_solution, Singapore ,"- DBS is helping Singapore’s facilities management sector get ready for the post-Covid-19 digital economy. It announced today the industry’s first digital collection solution for recurring and one-off resident payments, including conservancy fees, facility booking fees and sinking funds. QuickPay, developed by DBS Bank in collaboration with homegrown PropTech company IBASE Technology Pte Ltd, enables Management Corporation Strata Title (MCSTs) [1] and Managing Agent (MA) companies to collect resident payments digitally in the growing number of private residential estates, especially amid health and safety concerns over in-person cash and cheque payments amid the Covid-19 pandemic. With QuickPay, payments can be made easily with a simple scan of a unique QR code. By digitalising the highly manual and paper-based collections process, QuickPay helps to unlock productivity gains for the facilities management sector and enhances cash flow for MCSTs which are typically SMEs, all while delivering greater convenience to residents. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking at DBS, noted that the facilities management sector in Singapore could benefit substantially from digitalising its processes, both in terms of productivity gains and customer satisfaction. “Covid-19 has permanently altered both consumer behaviour and business operations, and people will increasingly expect more ‘contact-free’ touchpoints. This includes payments for facility management fees, which have been cumbersome and manual for far too long. With QuickPay, not only can MCSTs and MAs meet residents’ expectations of digital payment modes, they can also enjoy improved productivity as a result of optimised, digitalised workflows. QuickPay is expected to benefit residents of close to 24,000 units in more than 30 private estates across Singapore within the next three months, moving Singapore closer to achieving its vision of being a Smart Nation.” Available on the Qornerstone Estate property management platform, QuickPay passes transaction details into Qornerstone Estate, which automatically issues the electronic receipt, reconciles the payment and updates the MCSTs’ financial records. This frees MCST staff from the tedium of manual data entry, and over-the-counter transaction processing and documentation. Where previously an individual accountant would be stretched to manage anything more than five estates, with QuickPay, the same individual will now be able to manage ten estates easily. The digitalised collections process helps MCSTs and MAs mitigate the inherent risks of cash and cheque mishandling or loss of paper receipts and records. The solution also offers MCSTs lower transaction costs, reduced operating expenses, and expedited conversion of receivables to receipts, enhancing working capital management, especially crucial during Covid-19. Safe, Simple and Convenient Payments Residents will also find QuickPay a joy to use with its integrated support for PayNow and DBS PayLah! [2] payments, which were not available previously for MCST estates. Both payment methods are among the most prevalent in Singapore, with about two out of every three Singaporeans registered for PayNow [3] , and DBS recording over 2.3 million more transactions for PayLah! in January to March 2020 versus the same period last year, with the total value of transactions going up by 40% in the same period. DBS, currently estimated to have a 22% market share of Singapore’s MCSTs, provided the digital banking infrastructure and expertise to integrate the PayNow QR-based solution onto Qornerstone Estate. Payments are instant, and funds transferred in the same day, sparing residents the hassle of filling up physical cheques which take up to three business days to clear. Residents also enjoy the option of paying with their preferred mobile banking app by scanning a PayNow QR code printed on account statements, or downloading the Qommunity Resident app to view balances electronically and paying from within the app. Payment transaction details, including payer name, unit number, invoice reference number and MCST bank account, are embedded in each QR code, saving residents the hassle of keying in such details manually. Ernest Ong, CEO of IBASE Technology, said. “Our customers have been asking for an e-payment solution to help them automate payments collections for a long time now. We are glad to now answer this need so simply and effectively through our collaboration with DBS Bank. By adopting QuickPay, MCST estates and building owners can drive the digitalisation of property management with cost savings for the estate and the service provider.” Teo Poh Siang, Director of MA company Wisely 98 Pte Ltd said, “We are excited to roll out QuickPay in the estates we manage. Too much time and manpower is required to manage cash and cheque payments. I hope residents and SPs will embrace e-payments and I’m looking to automate payments reconciliation with QuickPay and help Wisely98 staff work more efficiently.” Pang Yoke Hong, MCST Chairman of The Casablanca, said, “QuickPay will help streamline our payment collection process, thereby minimising the risk of lost or bounced cheques and unaccounted cash. We look forward to our residents enjoying the convenience of making payments with a simple scan of a QR code, and having the collections immediately deposited into our MCST account with full transaction details automatically captured in the back-end accounting system without having staff doing paperwork.” MCSTs and MAs keen on finding out more about QuickPay can visit https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/QuickPay .

「星展豐盛私人客戶」服務屆滿兩周年表現亮眼,21 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/20200721_DBS_Taiwan_TPC_wealth_management_branch_anniversary, Taiwan ,"- 星展銀行（台灣）於2018年7月正式推出「星展豐盛私人客戶」，服務介於一般財富管理與私人銀行之間的高資產客戶，營運表現亮眼。2020年7月，適逢「星展豐盛私人客戶」屆滿兩周年，星展銀行（台灣）也將持續朝接地氣、接國際、接人才的「三接銀行」方向努力，深耕台灣市場。 2017年12月，因應合併原澳盛銀行財富管理業務後財富管理客群擴大，星展銀行（台灣）於2018年7月正式推出「星展豐盛私人客戶」，服務頂級財富管理客層，並於台北市信義區中心打造首間「星展豐盛私人客戶」旗艦分行。在服務理念明確、硬體設備到位、產品與服務完整的驅動下，「星展豐盛私人客戶」甫推出就有優異表現，並於業務成立一年後保持雙位數成長；而台灣財富管理業務也成為集團繼新加坡、香港後第三大財富管理市場。 做為一家以亞洲市場為重心的銀行，星展集團將台灣列為六大重點市場之一，是集團在亞洲佈局不可或缺的一環。與其他在台外商銀行相比，星展雖然進入台灣市場較晚，但也因此有機會能以不同的經營模式運作銀行業務，致力朝數位化銀行方向發展。 自 1983 年進入台灣市場以來，星展持續透過投資台灣擴大在台業務與客戶規模。繼2008 年收購寶華銀行的良好資產，將業務擴展至財富管理及中小型企業業務後，2017年12月，星展銀行（台灣）更承接澳盛銀行台灣個人金融及財富管理業務，在此基礎上，過去2年消費金融總客戶數持續成長逾6%。為永續經營台灣市場，星展銀行（台灣）於2019年7月進一步增資新台幣22億5千萬元，增資後資本額達322億5千億元，資本結構更為穩健，新增資金則持續投資數位創新，為未來在台拓展業務布局。 身為全球最佳數位銀行，星展銀行（台灣）致力打造全方位的數位通路與服務，並觀察到近年客戶金融服務使用型態也有所轉變。根據統計，截至2020年6月底為止，星展銀行（台灣） 網銀與行動銀行使用總人數較2017年底成長3倍，且有高達69%的轉帳交易和59%的換匯交易，都是透過網路銀行和行動銀行承做。另一方面，隨著數位化交易比例的上升，2020年上半年分行櫃檯每月平均臨櫃服務的交易筆數，則較前一年同期年減少18%，足見數位化已是無可抵擋的趨勢。 依據上述數位金融趨勢與消費者金融服務使用型態轉變，星展銀行（台灣）在評估分行服務重疊性及營運效益後，適度調整分行網絡，進行分行整併計畫。原屬被整併分行之客戶將轉由鄰近分行服務，客戶權益不受影響；原駐分行同仁亦將全數轉往鄰近分行服務，或依員工個人意願進行調動安排，以保障行員權益。 做為「接地氣」、「接國際」、「接人才」的「三接銀行」，星展銀行（台灣）在「接地氣」部分，除了在信用卡業務端支援iPass一卡通支付網絡，讓卡友能便利地以信用卡完成日常生活中的交通與小額支付外，也在社會公益上長期陪伴台灣在地社會企業成長。除了於今年疫情期間捐贈逾2,500萬元，購買社會企業物資並組裝成50,850份「星展暖心食袋」，由台灣食物銀行聯合會分享給因疫情陷入困頓的長者與弱勢家庭，更於7月11日號召超過200位員工與家屬，前往位於新北市八里的樂山教養院協助舉辦愛心義賣園遊會，關懷在地社區 。 為了讓台灣「接國際」，星展銀行（台灣）在導入數位創新方案的同時，也透過主動承作離岸風電融資，引進集團執行再生能源專案的專業融資經驗，提升台灣金融市場的國際視野。此外，響應金管會推廣雙語示範分行的目標，星展銀行（台灣）率先於2019年12月，在外籍人口密度高的天母地區，設立星展全台首間、同時也是台灣首批雙語示範分行。2020下半年，星展銀行（台灣）也計畫於更多分行推出雙語服務，協助提升台灣金融產業競爭力。 在「接人才」方面，星展銀行（台灣）亦長期以儲備主管計劃培養在地人才。看中台灣做為科技島，科技人才濟濟，星展也積極與主管機關及台灣頂尖大專院校接洽，計畫推出「5T人才培育計畫」（ T aiwan T op- T ier T echnology T alent P rogram），儲備未來星展發展科技的人才，同時讓台灣人才躍上國際舞台。 2020伊始，全球即遭逢新冠病毒疫情衝擊，對各行各業而言皆產生不同的挑戰。面對變動的環境，星展銀行（台灣）將持續配合主管機關政策，發展數位金融。 "
DBS Bank gives USD195 million loan to PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical Tbk to help the company deal with business challenges in the new normal | Bahasa,21 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_gives_USD195_million_loan_to_PT_Chandra_Asri_Petrochemical_Tbk_to_help_the_company_deal_with_business_challenges_in_the_new_normal, Indonesia ,"- DBS Bank provided financing for PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical Tbk (Chandra Asri) and helped maximize the company’s use of digital platforms DBS IDEAL and DBS RAPID to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of day-to-day business activities so that they can maintain sustainable business processes. The loan and digital support underlined DBS Bank’s commitment to helping its business partners amid the challenges in the new normal. DBS Bank has been providing Chandra Asri, its corporate customer since 2005, with a variety of banking services, such as cash management, trade facility, treasury, debt capital markets, and financing that focus on the comprehensive needs of the customer. DBS Bank provided USD195 million (Rp2.9 trillion) worth of trade financing and revolving credit facility for Chandra Asri to meet the company's working capital needs. DBS Bank sees that despite the current pandemic, domestic demand for Chandra Asri’s products remains high because it produces the raw materials for medical equipment such as masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). To be able to meet domestic demand, Chandra Asri is continuing with normal operations of its plant by implementing strict safety protocols, including by restricting physical presence at the plant to critical workers, and implementing a split-team arrangement for support staff to divide work between home and the office. During the period of large-scale social restrictions (PSBB), when product sales and billing processes run as usual and they have to apply separate work arrangements, Chandra Asri uses DBS Bank's digital corporate banking service, DBS IDEAL, to ensure hassle-free payment transactions. ""We want to show support for Chandra Asri as a corporate customer of DBS Bank in dealing with the current situation, including by providing financial assistance so that they can continue to grow their business. In addition, since May, Chandra Asri has been using our digital corporate banking service, DBS RAPID (Real Time Application Programming Interface), to fulfill its financial needs, especially during these difficult times, by digitizing the banking transaction process to ensure business sustainability,"" said Kunardy Lie, Corporate Banking Director, PT Bank DBS Indonesia. RAPID DBS is based on three pillars: Digitalization, Speed, and Inter-connectivity. These three pillars ensure seamless integration between DBS Bank and the systems in the clients’ companies that enable real time processing of payments, account receivables, retrieval of information about customer business workflows, and facilitating business transactions in the customer's network (ecosystem). As one of the key industry players in Indonesia, Chandra Asri is fully committed to continuing the growth of the petrochemical industry. Therefore, we appreciate DBS Bank’s faith in our company through support for our efforts to reactivate industrial growth to support national economic growth. We are pleased to partner with DBS to implement the RAPID system as part of our Digital Transformation Programme, to continuously improve to better serve our stakeholders with efficiency, innovation, and technology,"" said Andre Khor, Finance Director /Chief Financial Officer, Chandra Asri. Chandra Asri is the largest integrated petrochemical producer in Indonesia and operates the country’s only Naphtha cracker that produces Olefins (Ethylene, Propylene), Pygas and Mixed C4, as well as Polyolefins (Polyethylene and Polypropylene). With DBS RAPID, Chandra Asri can reduce remittance processing time as well as error in data inputting, which is in line with Chandra Asri's management's expectation in pursuing a prudent principle in managing its finances to remain sustainable and to be able to overcome the crisis.

DBS and the Singapore Judiciary rally community with a social purpose hackathon,20 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_the_Singapore_Judiciary_rally_community_with_a_social_purpose_hackathon, Singapore ,"- In looking to pre-emptively address the impact the Covid-19 pandemic may cast on Singapore’s social fabric, DBS and the Singapore Judiciary are jointly organising the inaugural ‘Hackathon for a Better World’ to start an action-oriented dialogue on transforming access to justice. This hackathon aims to encourage those with a passion to use law as a force for good to explore innovative solutions to enhance social justice. ‘Hackathon for a Better World’ stems from a shared desire by both DBS and the Singapore Judiciary to encourage the community to reimagine access to justice in the post-Covid-19 era, in light of impending shifts in the political, social and business landscape. In doing so, both organisations hope to foster a better understanding of social justice in Singapore, while creating a platform for participants to nurture creative ideas for furthering legal innovation. This also marks the first such collaboration between the Singapore Judiciary and a private corporation to encourage public innovation in the justice system. 37 teams comprising members from diverse backgrounds, ranging from practising lawyers, legal technologists, law students and staff from DBS and the Singapore Judiciary, have registered for this hackathon. They will be challenged to “hack” problem statements developed by DBS and the Singapore Judiciary: What role can the legal profession play to help everyone in society have better access to justice? How can businesses and the legal system collaborate to provide easier access to justice and improve customer experiences? How can the justice system become more agile, responsive and flexile to meet the needs of a rapidly evolving society? Mr Lam Chee Kin, Group Head of Legal, Compliance and Secretariat at DBS, said, “A post-pandemic world will still need to find common ground for trade and international relations, cultivated on universal and foundational concepts such as rule of law and access to justice. We are humbled to partner the Singapore Judiciary, and have chosen access to justice as our theme because it fosters a sense of community at many levels.” Mr Tan Ken Hwee, Chief Transformation and Innovation Officer for the Singapore Judiciary said “We are very happy to partner DBS in this hackathon. COVID-19 has shown that transformation is not just possible – it is essential if we are to meet the challenges brought about by this pandemic and other uncertainties. Learning from proven innovation frameworks used in leading private sector companies can enhance legal transformation and innovation and enhance access to justice.” A Different Hack for a Different Hackathon ‘Hackathon for a Better World’ adopts a unique “learn-as-you-hack” format, where participants work on their problem statements over the course of three months through an iterative process. This is unlike the usual hackathon format where participants solve problem statements over a few hours or a few days. The unconventional approach adopted in this instance allows participants to have ample room and space for their creativity while managing their existing commitments. This also creates a more conducive environment for participants to have deeper discussions with their identified stakeholders to shape sharper, more meaningful responses to the complex challenges before them. Participants will submit their pitches by 27 July and undergo a design thinking masterclass by DBS to learn about the bank’s in-house ‘4D’ (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver) innovation framework, so that they are equipped with the basic tools to identify potentially under-serviced societal needs, gain empathy and synthesise insights in developing their proposals. In addition, participants will be able to check in with mentors from DBS, the Singapore Judiciary, and volunteers from Singapore’s legal community for additional guidance. All submissions will be judged at the Tech.Law Fest 2020, currently scheduled on 1 October, with the winners expected to be announced shortly after.

Indonesia's Readiness to Implement Green Economy | Bahasa,17 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Indonesias_Readiness_to_Implement_Green_Economy, Indonesia ,"- A number of experts believe that green economy can help deal with the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, Asian Insights Conference 2020 held by Bank DBS Indonesia on July 16 took 'Fixing a Fragile World: Anticipating the Next Black Swan?' as its theme . Present as speakers at the panel discussion were Executive Director of Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari Gita Syahrani, Executive Chairman of the Green Trade Initiative Foundation Fitrian Ardiansyah and Landscape Indonesia Chief Executive Officer Agus Sari. ""Sustainability is one of the priorities and business focuses of Bank DBS Indonesia. We continually strive to apply values ​​and measures of sustainability in every line of our business, work culture and banking activities. The DBS Asian Insights Conference represents Bank DBS Indonesia's commitment as a banking institution that is driven by the goal of creating economic and environmental balance,"" said PT Bank DBS Indonesia President Director Paulus Sutisna. Besides government policies and stimulus packages, economists believe that green economy can boost Indonesia’s economy. Green economy is an idea that aims at improving people’s welfare while preventing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and overcoming the effects of climate change. Landscape Indonesia Chief Executive Officer Agus Sari said the government’s stimulus could lend weight to efforts to develop a green economy. The basic principle of sustainability dictates that economic, social, and environmental factors be mapped comprehensively. Sacrificing one of them will sacrifice all three. Furthermore, all three factors must be mapped to determine which sector is resilient under all conditions, including the current pandemic. The stimulus should not be given to vulnerable or even damaging sectors. “The pandemic is rare although everyone knew it was bound to happen. One way or another, is this a black swan? Not necessarily, because this is definitely happening, only we don't know when. Therefore, we must anticipate it although it is rare,"" he said. Agus added that the energy sector is one of the sectors that deserve full attention in the development of a green economy. There is still plenty of room for the development of renewable energy in the country. Furthermore, the pandemic also teaches us that the health and pharmaceutical sectors in Indonesia are still very vulnerable. This means it is important to develop the two sectors. West Java Province has started to take sustainability measures in development projects and manufacturing industries. ""We see seven opportunities that are the focus of West Java Province in developing the economy amid the pandemic. One of them is that our business and industry are heading toward sustainability. We are currently transforming five plastic factories into solar plants using municipal waste as combustible material to replace coal. The plants are being built in Bogor and several areas in West Java,"" said West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil. In addition, the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) has determined that low-carbon development can produce a gross domestic product (GDP) of more than 6% annually, starting now until 2045. The government has an important role to create a sustainable green investment strategy so that Indonesia's economic growth can get back on track. Preparations for the implementation of green economy are underway and have attracted the attention of investors and business people. Gita Syahrani, Executive Director of Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari, said that green investment is an effective stimulus in overcoming the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Local governments have adopted innovative policies for sustainable development that protect the environment while improving people’s prosperity, such as the Green Sigi Bylaw and the Regulation of the Siak Hijau Regent. This is to ensure that every development activity is carried out while maintaining ecological functions, such as water availability, good soil and air quality, and access to renewable energy sources. When this happens, then resilience against disaster, including Covid-19, will increase. Nevertheless, the large potential of green economy does not necessarily attract investors. High risk and a long process are some of the deterring factors for investors. In addition, profit forecasts are still uncertain. Green Trade Initiative Foundation Executive Chairman Fitrian Ardiansyah said that resilience in a green economy is very important, especially in terms of investment. ""This is because no investors will invest in it if the business does not last long or does not yield profits or cause new problems. Profit is related to productivity, to health and sustainability. Investors seek a business model that can boost productivity while ensuring sustainability and offering benefits to the environment and society,"" he said. Commenting on Fitrian’s statement, Gita Syahrani said that equitable development has always been a national target. ""However, when viewed from the flow of investment, it is not enough. This is a good time to attract investment that strengthens infrastructure and MSMEs, and support human resources for the development of domestic supply chains, especially for sustainable derivative products, based on a region’s potentials, such as honey, moringa, or other natural spices. Data shows that Indonesian consumers currently support local products, so I'm sure the penetration of sustainable local products into e-commerce platforms, for example, can increase, if supported by national policies."" Given these conditions, green economy is a necessity and can be considered for a valid development scenario. Each region will have its own added value. Further, the economy will also increasingly favor the people, not because they are entitled to it, but because they are able to manage local economies. Good cooperation between the central government and financial institutions and private companies is crucial to revive Indonesia's economy. Bank DBS Indonesia is committed to creating a balanced environment between the economy and business. ""As a bank, we continuously strive to apply the value of sustainability to the awareness of our role as a financial institution, which runs a sustainable business for future generations and the environment. Bank DBS Indonesia implements this value through leading and trusted banking services, and is curated according to customer needs. We are also actively involved in the development of social entrepreneurship in Indonesia through the DBS Foundation,"" said PT Bank DBS Indonesia President Director Paulus Sutisna.

"Economic and political recovery amid the pandemic, what’s next? | Bahasa",16 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Economic_and_political_recovery_amid_the_pandemic_whats_next, Indonesia ,"- Bank DBS held Asian Insights Conference 2020 in collaboration with Bahlil Lahadalia , Chairman of the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM), Ridwan Kamil , Governor of West Java, and Masyita Crystallin , Special Advisor to the Minister of Finance (Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy), and several other economic and political experts. The annual conference took “ Economy and Politics: Recovery from COVID19 - What’s Next? ” and “ Fixing a Fragile World: Anticipating the Next Black Swan? ” as its themes to offer the latest economic and political views and insights amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This was aimed at providing insights to help business players make decisions and determine their business directions and goals. “The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a slowdown in the global economy, including Indonesia. A recurring question is whether Indonesia can survive the pandemic as it did the 1998 crisis. We see that Indonesia today is stronger than 20 years ago based on various economic indicators, such as the GDP, foreign exchange reserves, foreign debt, a stronger banking sector, and a more in-depth financial market. The government has launched various stimulus packages for the people to maintain financial stability. Coordination between government institutions is very good, enabling banks to serve their customers well amid the pandemic. In line with the government’s efforts to revive the economy, we bring together economic and political experts to discuss policy directions in 2020 at DBS Asian Insights Conference 2020. Bank DBS Indonesia as a leading bank in terms of business and technology insights always seeks to help business players make decisions and determine their goals,” said Paulus Sutisna , President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia. Indonesia’s economic growth target, which was set at more than 5% in early 2020, is a significant challenge for Indonesia. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in early April lowered Indonesia’s economic growth projection to 0.5% from 5.1% in its early October 2019 projection. The Ministry of Finance said that Indonesia’s economy as a whole would be determined by the recovery in the third and fourth quarters. The government is still using the 2020 economic growth scenario of between -0.4% and 2.3%. “The Covid-19 pandemic is more than just a health emergency, it is also an economic emergency, and even some countries have entered a state of social and political emergency. We are optimistic the recovery measures will help West Java’s economy grow 2-3% in December 2020,” said West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil, “In addition, we are also confident that we will be the first province in Indonesia to move on from the pandemic. We see seven economic opportunities amid the pandemic: (1) investment moving from China to “Segitiga Rebana” [1] (2) technological self-reliant and development, (3) health industry growth with domestic manufacturing of health equipment, (4) industry 4.0 implementation in the new normal, (5) digital village development through technology implementation in villages (or through technology enabled empowerment of villagers), (6) sustainable economic and industry practices, and (7) local tourism development,” said West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil. At the same time, the central government deployed various strategies to drive the economy and restore people’s purchasing power. The strategies were complemented by various government incentives, including allowing people to delay income tax payment (articles 21, 22, and 25) for six months. In addition, the government has also relaxed the regulation on export duties for the industry sector. Masyita Crystallin , Special Advisor to the Minister of Finance (Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy), stated that the government has been working with the central bank to share the burden of handling the pandemic. A similar burden-sharing arrangement is also applied in all countries that rely on central banks to provide funds at a low cost. “We should establish the norms governing the matter. Therefore, what we do is not to print money or deploy helicopter money. Our scheme is in accordance with the market and remains a monetary instrument. Should Bank Indonesia need it, it can withdraw the instrument immediately,” she said. One of the strategies was to issue global sukuk with good yields a while back. The measure was taken to prevent an economic contraction and state budget constraints. The government has also taken anticipatory steps to deal with the pandemic. Several incentives have been given to businesses so that the economy can continue to run. The government expected the incentives to help people and businesses resume their activities, otherwise it will be more difficult for the business sector to resume activities. Efforts should be made to prevent this from happening and affecting the people. “We have prepared quite a long-term plan. This all depends on the policy related to the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic is also unpredictable in terms of its period and duration. We have prepared policies for the next three years,” she went on to say. In addition to the economic stimulus packages, the government also focused on increasing investment to curb the pace of the economic slowdown, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) prepared a strategy in the first quarter to encourage domestic investment and we have to pick the ball. I also want to explain that in terms of investment realization, the BKPM also wants quality investment realization. Quality investment is measured by, among other things, the spread of investment in Java and outside Java, which is now almost equal. Today, investment in Java accounts for 51.4% of the total investment and investment outside Java accounts for another 48.6%. We not only serve large investments but also small investments in all regions. At the moment, we are focusing on the realization of investments in import substitutes that give added economic value,” said Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board Chairman Bahlil Lahadalia . In addition to the economic challenges faced by Indonesia, political challenges also confront President Jokowi’s government, from public rejection of the Omnibus Law to public criticism of the Covid-19 pandemic handling. Furthermore, September will see simultaneous regional elections across Indonesia. Political parties will compete to gain public support so that their candidates can win the elections. This will be a big asset for the 2024 general election. The challenges will certainly have a destabilizing effect on Indonesia’s political directions. The DBS Asian Insights Conference embodied Bank DBS Indonesia’s commitment as a banking institution that is driven by the goal of creating economic and environmental balance. Paulus Sutisna added, “Becoming a bank that is driven by sustainable goals is the DNA of Bank DBS Indonesia. We continue to innovate to become a bank that promotes economic, social, and environmental balance through our banking products and services to facilitate customers in doing banking activities while creating social impacts through banking with us.” Among the speakers who joined the DBS Asian Insights Conference were Piter Abdullah , Research Director, Core Indonesia; Burhanuddin Muhtadi, Executive Director of Indonesian Political Indicator; Gita Syahrani, Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari; Fitrian Ardiansyah, Director, Yayasan Inisiatif Dagang Hijau; and Agus Sari , Chief Executive Officer, Landscape Indonesia.

Contour and DBS support first secured letter of credit transaction between Nanjing Iron & Steel and Rio Tinto on blockchain network,15 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Contour_and_DBS_support_first_secured_letter_of_credit_transaction_between_Nanjing_Iron_amp_Steel_and_Rio_Tinto_on_blockchain_network, Singapore ,"- Contour , together with member bank, DBS Bank , continue to push the digitalisation of trade finance with the completion of the network’s first fully digital end-to-end secured Letter of Credit (LC) between Nanjing Iron & Steel, Singapore Jinteng International and Hope Downs Marketing Company (an equal Joint Venture between Rio Tinto and Hancock Prospecting). Facilitated by DBS Bank as the issuing and advising bank, which played an integral role in connecting the parties across the mining value chain, and Contour partner essDOCS, which enabled management of the electronic bill of lading through its CargoDocs solution, the approval of key contract terms, LC issuance and presentation of export documents under the LC were carried out electronically from start to finish on the Contour network. This not only resulted in reduced trade document turnaround times but also provided greater transparency with all parties having access to real-time status updates at each step of the transaction. By providing a neutral and open network, Contour is able to offer its solution to a wide range of financial institutions and corporates, allowing individual technology providers to integrate within its network to further streamline LC issuance. The transaction highlights Contour’s growing presence in Asia as an industry standard for digitising trade finance documentation, and marks DBS Bank’s second transaction on the network since it became a member bank in May. Carl Wegner, CEO at Contour, said: “With yet another transaction pair on our network, we are showing the full scope of what a blockchain solution can offer to trade finance. This is a hugely positive sign of a changing industry - organisations are taking advantage of our technological solution and using it to transform a previously paper-based process that is outdated and unfit for purpose in the modern world. Our growing presence in China, working with some of the region’s leading exporters, showcases the benefits of our network and we are confident we will see more organisations take advantage of blockchain for trade finance throughout the rest of the year.” Sriram Muthukrishnan, Group Head of Trade Product Management, DBS Bank, said: “An ecosystems approach is vital to unlocking a network effect to propel trade into the digital era, and continued collaboration across businesses, banks and technology providers remains key. The silver lining arising from challenges faced in the current environment is a rapid acceleration and acceptance across all industries and geographies of the need to digitalise to survive and thrive in the ‘new normal’, and we expect to see more companies transitioning from analogue-based trade finance processes to digital ones in the near future.” Alexander Goulandris, Co-CEO, essDOCS said: “The imperative to digitise trade and trade finance has become increasingly vital as the world adjusts to life post-Covid. The results of our joint work with Contour are bearing major fruit and we are confident that milestone transactions combining CargoDocs and Contour will continue to gain pace, as banks and corporates seek to benefit from the major efficiencies gained by being a part of this essential digital trade ecosystem.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

Economic crisis due to pandemic: What makes Indonesia survive? | Bahasa,15 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Economic_crisis_due_to_pandemic_What_makes_Indonesia_survive, Indonesia ,"- As one of the economic powers to be reckoned with in ASEAN, Indonesia was able to survive amid the Covid-19-triggered economic crisis. As a banking institution that has been actively providing comprehensive insights about Indonesia's economy and politics, Bank DBS Indonesia on July 16, 2020 held the DBS Asian Insights Conference that took ‘ Navigating a brave new world ’ as its theme. Leading up to DBS Asian Insights Conference 2020, Bank DBS Indonesia held DBS Insights for Business Leaders to observe, analyse and present the perspectives of experts on the latest economic conditions. In a session titled ‘ Economies in Transition (Indonesia) ’, DBS Chief Economist Taimur Baig had a discussion with President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia Paulus Sutisna to present insights about Indonesia’s economic condition amid the pandemic. Following is the summary of the discussion about Indonesia’s economic condition amid the pandemic: Comparison between the 2020 pandemic-triggered crisis and the 1998 crisis Before the Covid-19-triggered global crisis, Indonesia experienced a similar situation in 1998. Compared with the 1998 crisis, Indonesia’s economy is far stronger and healthier today. This is reflected in several aspects, including the five-fold increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) to USD1.1 trillion and a seven-fold increase in foreign exchange reserves to USD129 billion. External debt, which is always a concern, increased by 3.1 times to USD404 billion. One aspect that needs to be underlined is that Indonesia’s debt-to-GDP ratio has declined to 36% from 57%. Interestingly, Indonesia, both in 1998 and 2020, saw the rupiah depreciate to 16,500-16,600 to the dollar. The difference is that the depreciation rate in 2020 was 16% compared to 500% in 1998. Paulus Sutisna revealed that the most significant difference was felt in terms of political stability. “In contrast to the political situation in 1998, which was very unstable, the current condition is far more stable, with President Jokowi serving his second term. In addition, the Jokowi government has issued various stimulus policies aimed at reducing poverty.” Also, unlike in 1998 when social security protection was not available, the public is now well-protected by the social security programme or Healthcare and Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan) that allows them to enjoy free medical treatment. To minimise the impacts of Covid-19, the government has increased the state budget by USD27 billion to finance health services. In addition to Indonesia’s far more stable economic condition today, Taimur sees that the Jokowi government’s policies also give significant impacts. “Various stimulus that are implemented with a main focus on providing services for the poor should help maintain economic stability.” Efforts to seize opportunities amidst Covid-19 pandemic Although Indonesia has been hit by a Covid-19-triggered economic crisis, Bank DBS Indonesia sees that the digital economy has the potential to drive national economic recovery. As one of the countries with the highest social media participation, Indonesia has seen rapid growth in digital economy over the past decade. Indonesia has six unicorns, namely Gojek, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Traveloka, OVO and JD.ID. With the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) imposed by the government amid the pandemic, the logistics sector is enjoying a positive trend as people tend to shop on e-commerce to fulfill their daily needs. As one of the pioneers of digital banking in Indonesia, digibank by DBS has seen an increase in popularity and reliance on e-commerce during the pandemic. “We are fortunate because we have been equipped with capable technology infrastructure during the pandemic. Regarding digibank by DBS, we see a much better acceptance during this pandemic. Today’s condition offers a strong opportunity to bring in new customers as they shift from transactions at branch offices to transactions via mobile phones. With new features added to the application, digibank by DBS is able to meet the growing and fast-changing customer needs,” Paulus said. From the corporate side, the work from home (WFH) policy has also encouraged people to utilise digital channels such as IDEAL from Bank DBS Indonesia that also posted growth amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “As employee safety becomes the main priority, 62% of Bank DBS Indonesia employees are able to work from home. This transformation allows employees who are currently working from home to minimise disruptions when serving customers. This is a reality during the Covid-19 period; in the past, everything took longer to be implemented in terms of digital, but now it’s happening and working. This is a one way move that won’t ever go back to the old school method,” Paulus and Taimur added. Indonesia’s economic condition post-Covid-19 pandemic Health infrastructure in Indonesia is facing many challenges and is expected to take longer to recover compared to other ASEAN countries with stronger and more solid health infrastructure. Several studies predicted that Indonesia’s health condition will recover in September-October 2020. “Unlike the health condition, Indonesia’s economy is expected to recover faster. This is possible because Indonesia is one of the countries with strong domestic demands,” Paulus said. Historically, Indonesia’s average export-to-GDP ratio is 20%-25%. In a normal situation, Indonesia lags behind other countries that have a higher percentage. Taimur shared Paulus’ opinion, adding that, “Amid the pandemic, countries like Indonesia actually enjoy benefits. Thanks to a strong domestic demand, Indonesia does not need to focus too much on export and can focus more on government spending that can boost Indonesia’s economy.” In other words, the current condition drags down the economy of several countries that initially grew faster than Indonesia when external demand slowed. On the contrary, countries like Indonesia that depend on domestic demand have the potential to survive better. The Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the global order, paralysing the global economy, including Indonesia. Entering the new normal, it is time for people to reorganise their life and to start making up for the losses caused by the pandemic. Through the DBS Asian Insights Conference 2020, Bank DBS Indonesia gathered experts from the Government as Mr. Bahlil Lahadalia; Head of Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM), Mr. Ridwan Kamil, Governor of West Java and experts in economic, as well experts in the field of sustainability to share their perspective related to not only Indonesia’s economy condition recovery, also the environmental conditions or sustainability in Indonesia, as well measures that can be done. Held virtually, this annual conference has two main topics, namely “ Economy and Politics : Recovery from COVID19 - What’s Next?” and “Fixing a Fragile World: Anticipating the Next Black Swan? ”  [END]   About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

Gojek integrates with DBS Paylah! platform to expand access to ride-hailing service,15 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Gojek_integrates_with_DBS_Paylah_platform_to_expand_access_to_ride_hailing_service, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank and Gojek today announced that more than 1.7 million DBS PayLah! users can now book and pay for their Gojek rides directly through the PayLah! platform. The move will provide more convenient access to transport services and boost the adoption of digital payments. Users can now book and pay for their Gojek rides directly and seamlessly on DBS PayLah! and receive curated offers from other PayLah! merchants at the same time The integration of Gojek’s services into the DBS PayLah! platform deepens the strategic partnership between the two companies, which was inked in 2018 at the time of Gojek’s launch in Singapore, where all five million DBS/POSB customers enjoyed exclusive early access to Gojek’s services. It follows the successful rollout last year of DBS PayLah! as a default in-app payment option in the Gojek app, which enables users - who may not own a debit or credit card and need an alternative to cash payments - to enjoy the convenience of digital payments and greater peace-of-mind from not having to manage physical money. More than 100,000 Gojek rides were booked by PayLah! users in the first month of the launch. “Consumers can fully appreciate the importance of digital payment options especially as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, with personal hygiene and safety now being prioritised highly. This is evident from the exponential increase witnessed in the adoption of our digital banking and payments services,” said Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Head. “Ride-hailing is among one of the most frequently used services by our DBS PayLah! users. Allowing them to now conveniently book and pay for their Gojek rides via PayLah! further enhances their user experience as there’s no need to toggle between apps. The integration also enables us to better engage PayLah! users via our large range of services and personalised offers curated just for them, to help serve their everyday needs.” The adoption of digital payments for ride-hailing continues to grow, with Gojek’s daily ride-hailing transactions paid for in cash dropping from 35% to 30% from mid-2019 to mid-2020. According to Gojek, education institutions are common destinations among commuters who continue to choose to pay for their rides in cash. “These commuters are likely tertiary students who receive their monthly allowance from their parents in cash,” explained Shee. “We are working with several tertiary education institutions on a financial literacy curriculum, where we teach students financial planning concepts and fundamentals of digital payments via our NAV Planner. This has helped, and will continue to help, shift the traditional cash-based approach so that more students can make use of digital payments.” Lien Choong Luen, General Manager of Gojek Singapore, added: “The integration of a Gojek tile in the DBS PayLah! app is timely and benefits users of both PayLah! and Gojek. Not only will it facilitate more convenient access to our ride-hailing service, it also strengthens the use of cashless payments among our commuters, which is key as we adapt to a new way of living where hygiene, health and safety have become paramount. To create a safer ride environment, we have been encouraging customers to use contactless payments and providing complimentary car sanitisation services to driver-partners. We look forward to working with DBS – which has been a valued strategic partner – to find new ways to support and delight our users.” In April, DBS and Gojek collaborated on several initiatives to extend support to Gojek’s driver-partners and the wider community in Singapore. They include: A three-part financial planning webinar series by DBS for Gojek driver-partners , which covered topics such as managing one’s personal finances and how to plan for your children’s education needs. Enabling the instant transfer of earnings support funds to Gojek’s driver-partners during the circuit breaker period, for which DBS waived all payment processing fees as goodwill. Delivering care packs to 2,000 households in Singapore under the “PAssion CARES for You” initiative, as food ration deliveries to vulnerable households by volunteers were affected in view of restrictions imposed during the circuit breaker period. To commemorate the launch of the new integration, the first 20,000 customers who book a Gojek ride through DBS PayLah! between 13 July and 31 August can redeem a cash rebate of SGD 3. DBS will also offer Gojek riders personalised offers or rebates curated from DBS PayLah! partners such as Dunkin' Donuts, Gong Cha and Foodpanda.

Aftermath of Covid-19: Innovation in trade and cash management | Bahasa,10 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Aftermath_of_Covid_19__Innovation_in_trade_and_cash_management, Indonesia ,"- In the lead up to DBS Bank’s biennial flagship event, DBS Asian Insights Conference 2020, DBS has organised a series of group media briefing sessions inviting media across the region to glean insights on how to navigate a post-pandemic world. On 6 July, John Laurens, Group Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank , led a media briefing session on the topic; Aftermath of Covid-19: Innovation in trade and cash management , garnering media turnout across Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Taiwan and the UK. Mr Laurens shared that Covid-19 has been driving shifts in trade and supply chains and added that trade volumes have been impacted by the overall slowdown in the global economy. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) estimates global trade will fall by 18.5% in 2Q2020 compared to the same period last year. This is supported by the forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the volume of goods and services trade will decline by 12% in 2020. Trade volumes also fell across all markets month-on-month in April, though Emerging Asia has been the most resilient (US -16.8%, Europe -20.1%, Emerging Asia (including China and India) -6%). Other key takeaways from the session include: Challenges faced by businesses across Asia Supply chain disruption leading to delay in cash realisation Globally markets have seen demand curtailment, forcing cancelled orders, late payments and prolonged factory shutdowns Cash conversion cycles have therefore lengthened SMEs, especially, struggling with adequate cash flow and access to capital Operating challenges amidst lockdown Asian production centres having been under labour workforce restriction face logistical bottlenecks Work from home arrangements make it operationally difficult to continue manual workflows (e.g. wet signatures) Disruption to transmission of physical documents and claiming of goods at ports Disrupted access to liquidity What does the “new normal” look like for businesses Replumbing/shortening of supply chains through reshoring/nearshoring Shift of major supply chains into ASEAN Diversification of manufacturing or supplier sources Rise of low-costs markets, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia Rise of ecosystems with entire supply chains participating on a single platform Facilitates greater transparency; enables harnessing of data analytics E-commerce gaining greater importance Digital innovations to support revival of economies in the aftermath Employment of 5G and the advent of new 5G-enabled business models/opportunities Application of IoT-based solutions across commercial, risk management and sustainability agenda Accelerated shift to cloud to reduce technology investment costs and scalability (up and down) Adapting to the new future of work More home-based employees and reduced business travel 5-year outlook for DBS’ transaction banking business Global leadership in digital transaction banking maintained Rapid pace of digital adoption to continue as analogue-based transactional and informational activities transition to fully digital processes Extensive cloud/API-based interactivity with customers and ecosystem partners to be the norm and creating multi-dimensional platform business opportunities across the wholesale bank franchise Data-driven business model to bring out cross-sell opportunities across digital client advisory and servicing, analytics-based financing, treasury and risk management New product development driven by technological advances in areas such as 5G, IoT and digital identity Growth in key/strategic markets remains robust Continued double digit volume growth in strategic growth markets, including India, Greater Bay Area and Indonesia Continued exponential growth in the Vietnam market and Australia transaction banking business build completed and well established.

DBS launches world’s first sustainable and transition finance framework and taxonomy to help clients advance on sustainability agenda | Bahasa,09 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_worlds_first_sustainable_and_transition_finance_framework_and_taxonomy_to_help_clients_advance_on_sustainability_agenda_ID, Indonesia ,"- As part of DBS’ efforts to partner clients from key industries to transition to a low-carbon economy, DBS today published a Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy. The world’s first Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy by a bank will form the bedrock for DBS to engage with clients who are furthering their sustainability agenda. The taxonomy will serve as a reference to guide clients to adapt and build resilience in the face of climate change, resource scarcity and address critical global issues such as social inequality. To encourage greater transparency in sustainable and transition economic activities, the taxonomy outlines the way DBS manages transactions that are classified as “Green”, “Transition” and/or contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). It also summarises a broad list of eligible economic activities – be it the use of recycled plastics for apparel making, or an electricity grid upgrade to enable integration of intermittent renewable energy. Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Institutional Banking, said that the introduction of this framework reinforces the bank’s efforts to advance sustainable development by facilitating the categorisation, monitoring and reporting of sustainable financing not just in DBS but in the banking industry. “As a purpose-driven bank, we are constantly looking for ways that our business can leave a positive impact. This framework is an extension of that commitment, with a comprehensive approach that can be summed up in three ‘T’s – Transition, Transactions and Transparency. While pursuing our own sustainability goals, we want to encourage companies to transition towards more carbon efficient operations by considering commercially viable greener alternatives. The second ‘T’ is for the sustainable finance transactions we have completed. We have a track record of almost 100 deals worth SGD12 billion that were closed and mandated over the last two-and-a-half years. The third ‘T’ is for the emphasis on transparency. We welcome a constructive debate on ways to achieve sustainable development while creating value for all. DBS – first Singapore bank to offer Transition Financing With the launch of the taxonomy, DBS will also be the first Singapore bank to offer Transition Financing. DBS will take a prudent, scientific approach to evaluate the transitional qualities of the economic activities and whether clients have a strategy to adapt their businesses to arrive at the ambition of the Paris Agreement. Yulanda Chung, Head of Sustainability, Institutional Banking Group, said that addressing transition financing is important as achieving climate goals require a significant reduction of carbon emissions. “In many sectors, clients are realising that decarbonising solutions are at a nascent stage of growth. As a result, solutions may not yet be available at scale due to cost and technological barriers.” “There are many interpretations of what constitutes transition finance. The bottom line is we cannot afford to dismiss clients who carry out activities which are less than dark-green but are nonetheless part of the mainstream economy instrumental to getting us below 1.5-degree temperature increase. Every transitional step towards reducing carbon footprint will make a significant, cumulative difference over time.” The implementation of the framework will involve robust governance and reporting processes that enable transparency.  The framework has also received a second party opinion from CICERO Green which has opined on the taxonomy and provided a broad, qualitative review of the climate and environmental risks and ambitions.

The New Normal Office: A peek into Bank DBS Indonesia's efforts to create a safe and comfortable work environment amid pandemic | Bahasa,02 Jul 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/The_New_Normal_Office_A_peek_into_Bank_DBS_Indonesias_efforts_to_create_a_safe_and_comfortable_work_environment_amid_pandemic, Indonesia ,"- Entering the new normal amid the Covid-19 pandemic, several regions in Indonesia, including Jakarta, are transitioning from the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB). The government has relaxed social restrictions during the transition period by allowing public spaces, including offices, to reopen. Most companies have resumed operations by making adjustments to their working hours and implementing split-team work arrangements. A number of offices have also fully resumed operations by implementing health protocols to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Although each individual has his or her own health protocol outside the home, employees are still concerned about the risk of exposure to the virus. Therefore, it is important that every company and office building manager implements strict and detailed health protocols. From the time the pandemic first hit in Indonesia to the current new normal, Bank DBS Indonesia as a financial institution that conducts business and banking practices responsibly has implemented strict health protocols and made operational adjustments, especially in matters involving the safety and health of employees, customers and business partners. Want to know more about the health protocols at Bank DBS Indonesia’s office? Take a look at the following! Distribution of ‘my care’ packages Employees are the most valuable asset for a company. Without them, a company’s survival could be at serious risk. Safety and comfort during the trip to the office and back home is a top priority. To deal with the challenges of the pandemic, Bank DBS Indonesia distributed the first round of care packages containing masks, vitamin C and hand sanitizers to employees in March. In May, another package was distributed to provide a sense of comfort and security for employees who need to work outside the home. Efforts to implement work from home (WFH) policy As we all know, banking is one of the few industries required by the government to remain operational during the PSBB. By prioritising employee safety and ensuring excellent service for customers, Bank DBS Indonesia made serious efforts to implement the work from home policy for the majority of its employees. The policy is supported by strong infrastructure and a good workplace culture. With technology and good quality human resources, work can be completed and productivity can be maintained while minimising health risks amid the pandemic. As of the third week of June 2020, more than 50% of DBS Indonesia's employees have been working from home. Care Initiative The WFH policy means employees must get used to working from home. Bank DBS Indonesia understands that not all employees have adequate work facilities in their home. Therefore, the bank allocated funds that can be used by employees to pay for their Internet bills and transportation allowance for employees who need to go to the office and do not own vehicles. These funds are used at the discretion of each line manager to facilitate the transition to the WFH policy. Provision of vitamins and medical check-ups through General iFlex Every DBS employee who fulfills the requirements is entitled to benefits from General iFlex in the form of budget allocations they can use to get medical check-ups, purchase eyewear, and other matters related to employee health. Starting from March 2020, these benefits also cover purchases of all types of vitamins, personal protective needs such as masks and hand sanitizers, as well as independent medical check-ups when employees want to have a swab test for themselves and their family members. Physical distancing at all times Physical distancing has become a necessity for every individual when doing activity outside the home and is a major step in protecting themselves from the risk of exposure to the virus while in public spaces, including in the work area. Bank DBS Indonesia applies quite a strict physical distancing policy by reorganising the structure of employee placement in the office area. Each team is divided into two teams that are placed in different office areas. Bank DBS Indonesia also divides employees at the branch offices into different shifts. Furthermore, every table and chair are marked to indicate the areas employees can conduct their activity. This helps employees maintain a safe distance anytime and anywhere while in the office area. Enforcement of international office cleaning standards Viruses and bacteria can be spread through objects or areas that are touched by a lot of people, such as door handles, stair railing, elevator buttons, work desks, teller tables, ATMs and many more. Cleaning public areas in accordance with strict health standards and protocols is one way to to curb the spread of Covid-19. Bank DBS Indonesia sprays antimicrobial fluid by the hour. Antimicrobial fluid is a coating applied to prevent bacteria and viruses from sticking. The cleaning fluid is used in all areas of Changi Airport, Singapore. Healthy food the key to stamina During the intensive PSBB period in Jakarta, Bank DBS Indonesia provided lunch boxes for every employee who had to come to the office. The meal was served in the dining room on each floor of the office area under strict physical distancing protocols. In addition, every employee was also required to bring their own cutlery to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Ready to distribute medical assistance To prevent the spread of Covid-19 while maintaining safety at Bank DBS Indonesia’s premises, Bank DBS Indonesia is always ready to provide medical assistance to all employees to maintain their physical and mental health. Employees can take part in online discussions on wellness via webinars. In addition, employees can access online doctor consultation services through a teleconsultation platform made available through collaboration with our insurance providers. Furthermore, according to the bank’s Covid-19 handling protocols, when employees show symptoms of Covid-19, the Human Resources division will make arrangements for the Rapid and (Polymerase Chain Reaction) PCR Swab tests. Employees are also provided with an online platform for reporting body temperature every day so that the management is able to monitor employee health. ""The pandemic and new normal are our main focus in looking after each other in terms of mutual health and safety. As a responsible banking institution, we, together with our employees, always prioritise a safe and comfortable work environment to break the chain of Covid-19 infections through our health protocols,"" said PT Bank DBS Indonesia Human Resources Director, Satia Indrarini. Being a bank that is driven by sustainable goals is the DNA of Bank DBS Indonesia. Therefore, Bank DBS Indonesia continues to innovate to become a bank that promotes economic, social and environmental balance.

Bank DBS Indonesia initiates #MakanTanpaSisa movement to reduce food waste in Indonesia as part of Towards Zero Food Waste campaign | Bahasa,30 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Bank_DBS_Indonesia_initiates_MakanTanpaSisa_movement_to_reduce_food_waste_in_Indonesia_as_part_of_Towards_Zero_Food_Waste_campaign, Indonesia ,"- Food waste is rarely considered problematic in Indonesia although the country produces around 64 million tonnes of garbage annually, with 50% of the total waste comprising organic waste, including food waste. “The Food Sustainable Index 2018” published by The Economist Intelligence Unit named Indonesia the second-largest food waste producer in the world with 13 million tonnes of food waste produced annually, an amount sufficient to feed 28 million people. In view of the fact, Bank DBS Indonesia launched the 'Towards Zero Food Waste' campaign to encourage people to pay more attention to and be more concerned about food waste through the #MakanTanpaSisa movement. The movement invites people to make reducing food waste a daily habit. Furthermore, through this campaign, people can also participate in helping others who have difficulty obtaining nutritious food during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Through the #MakanTanpaSisa movement, Bank DBS Indonesia encourages people to reduce food waste in Indonesia and to help others, especially people affected by pandemic Covid-19, such as those who have lost their job, have difficulty getting food supply, and those who need vitamins and nutritious food to stay alive,"" said Mona Monika, Executive Director, Head of Group Strategic Marketing Communication PT Bank DBS. The main activity undertaken was to rally support through the #MakanTanpaSisa movement. Complete information is available on go.dbs.com/id-lmwl . In addition to supporting this movement, there are three things that can be done. Firstly, through the ""Watch to Donate"" campaign video. Watch and invite as many people as possible to watch the campaign video of the following movement: https://go.dbs.com/makantanpasisa-id . Help gather up to 10 million views and Bank DBS Indonesia will donate 8 tonnes worth of meals for people in need in collaboration with Foodbank of Indonesia. Since its launch on 22 April to coincide with Earth Day, the movement has collected 2 tonnes of meals and continues to invite people to participate. Secondly, people can contribute by: taking photos of food and empty plates (before and after eating) or making other attempts to reduce food waste. Upload the photos on Instagram, mention @dbsbankid @digibankid @livemoresociety, and share them by tagging three friends using the #LivemoreWasteless #MakanTanpaSisa #BersamaLawanCorona hashtag. Each post contributes to converting spreading goodness into food donations. Thirdly, digibank by DBS credit card holders can contribute through the ""Buy 1 Meal to Give 1 Meal"" program.

DBS launches world’s first sustainable and transition finance framework and taxonomy to help clients advance on sustainability agenda | 繁體 | 简体,29 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_worlds_first_sustainable_and_transition_finance_framework_and_taxonomy_to_help_clients_advance_on_sustainability_agenda, Singapore ,"- As part of DBS’ efforts to partner clients from key industries to transition to a low-carbon economy, DBS today published a Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy. The world’s first Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy by a bank will form the bedrock for DBS to engage with clients who are furthering their sustainability agenda. The taxonomy will serve as a reference to guide clients to adapt and build resilience in the face of climate change, resource scarcity and address critical global issues such as social inequality. To encourage greater transparency in sustainable and transition economic activities, the taxonomy outlines the way DBS manages transactions that are classified as “Green”, “Transition” and/or contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) [1] . It also summarises a broad list of eligible economic activities – be it the use of recycled plastics for apparel making, or an electricity grid upgrade to enable integration of intermittent renewable energy. Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Institutional Banking, said that the introduction of this framework reinforces the bank’s efforts to advance sustainable development by facilitating the categorisation, monitoring and reporting of sustainable financing not just in DBS but in the banking industry. “As a purpose-driven bank, we are constantly looking for ways that our business can leave a positive impact. This framework is an extension of that commitment, with a comprehensive approach that can be summed up in three ‘T’s – Transition, Transactions and Transparency. While pursuing our own sustainability goals, we want to encourage companies to transition towards more carbon efficient operations by considering commercially viable greener alternatives. The second ‘T’ is for the sustainable finance transactions we have completed. We have a track record of almost 100 deals worth SGD12 billion that were closed and mandated over the last two-and-a-half years. The third ‘T’ is for the emphasis on transparency. We welcome a constructive debate on ways to achieve sustainable development while creating value for all.” DBS – first Singapore bank to offer Transition Financing With the launch of the taxonomy, DBS will also be the first Singapore bank to offer Transition Financing. DBS will take a prudent, scientific approach to evaluate the transitional qualities of the economic activities and whether clients have a strategy to adapt their businesses to arrive at the ambition of the Paris Agreement [2] . Yulanda Chung, Head of Sustainability, Institutional Banking Group, said that addressing transition financing is important as achieving climate goals require a significant reduction of carbon emissions. “In many sectors, clients are realising that decarbonising solutions are at a nascent stage of growth. As a result, solutions may not yet be available at scale due to cost and technological barriers.” “There are many interpretations of what constitutes transition finance. The bottom line is we cannot afford to dismiss clients who carry out activities which are less than dark-green but are nonetheless part of the mainstream economy instrumental to getting us below 1.5-degree temperature increase. Every transitional step towards reducing carbon footprint will make a significant, cumulative difference over time.” The implementation of the framework will involve robust governance and reporting processes that enable transparency. The framework has also received a second party opinion from CICERO Green [3] which has opined on the taxonomy and provided a broad, qualitative review of the climate and environmental risks and ambitions. For further information, please visit DBS Sustainability . [1] The World Economic Forum estimates that there is a USD2.5 trillion annual financing gap that stands in the way of the international community achieving its Sustainable Development Goals. [2] The central aim of The Paris Agreement is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. [3]  CICERO Shades of Green is an independent research-based organisation that provides independent environmental assessments of green and sustainability bond frameworks and the issuer’s relevant internal governance procedures.

DBS CIO Insights 3Q20: Top five investment takeaways | Bahasa,29 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_CIO_Insights_3Q20_Top_five_investment_takeaways, Indonesia ,"- DBS Chief Investment Office issued the DBS CIO Insights report for 3Q20  (third quarter of the year 2020). The report, titled Resilient in the Storm , presented the top five investment takeaways on 3Q20 in particular in the new normal era. ""We see major changes in the way of life, work, and play as a result of the impact of the pandemic. Therefore, in this third quarter, we highlighted opportunities in the post-pandemic era such as diversified supply chains, rising eSports, and green investment growth that focuses on environmental, social, and governance. We hope to give an idea of the opportunity to enter the world that is constantly changing,"" said Hou Wey Fook, Chief Investment Officer, Consumer Banking & Wealth Management Bank DBS. Top five recommendations DBS CIO Insights 3Q20 are: 1) Prefer Equities over Bonds Valuations in line with long-term trends. Although P/E valuation for global markets is currently looking rich given the drastic earnings downgrades, in our view, it is a fallacy to compare valuations today with that of yesteryears given current low inflation and interest rates. Earnings yield vs bond yields and inflation are currently in line with long-term trends.  No correlation between economy and GDP.  As global macro data continue to plummet, there is increasing market chatter that a prolonged equity bear market is imminent. Intuitively, this may seem logical. However, we argue that : Historical relationship between the S&P 500 and the economy is insignificant; Sectoral composition is a bigger determinant of market returns and on this basis, we believe markets with huge Technology exposure (such as the US) will stand a higher chance of grinding higher despite downbeat headline macro data. FOMO re-emergence. We first espoused the notion of FOMO (the “fear of missing out”) driving global risks assets back in December 2019 when we published our 1Q20 CIO Insights. Our view was timely as the S&P 500 notched further gains before COVID-19 came along and triggered the selloff. But the high octane rebound since late-March suggests that FOMO is back in the works and this is evident from: Muted fund outflows from equities during the sell-down as portfolio allocators maintain strategic exposure to equities. Based on EPFR Global data, a total of USD33.5b exited from the asset class in 1Q20. This is 23% lower than the average quarterly outflows of USD43.6b in 2019, a year which saw the S&P 500 notching gains of 29%. Interestingly, it was the bond asset class that registered the larger outflows of USD107.1b during this period as liquidity squeeze hurt the bond asset class more. Muted market reaction to incoming macro and corporate data. Acceleration of the global bifurcation trends. T he global disruption wave has led to paradigm shifts in business models around the world. Today, e-Commerce has overtaken brick-and-mortar stores as the retail format of choice. Similarly, robotics and automation are displacing traditional manufacturing methods in factories. This evolution has been ongoing for some time now. But the pandemic has accelerated it. It is no more “business as usual” and structural changes such as from offline-to-online, the rise of work- from-home, and sports turning from traditional to virtual e-Sports, are on the way. Technology is a geared beneficiary of the post-pandemic landscape. 2) Underweight Bonds; Favour US IG; prefer Asia HY over global HY We continue to underweight bonds given near zero to negative interest rates globally. Given widespread unemployment and sluggish consumption in the developed world, monetary accommodation is expected to persist in the course of 2020. We expect the UST 10-year yield to end the year at 0.95% before trending higher in the course of 2021. In the credit space, we have turned positive on US IG bonds as the current spreads-implied default rate is not justifiable in our view, given prevailing macro conditions. Within the HY segment, we continue to favour Asia HY over global HY given the region’s attractive spreads differential. 3) Overweight US and Asia ex-Japan equities US: With the global bifurcation trend, we Overweight markets with huge technology-related sectors. Among G-3, US has the highest tech composition. US Technology has generally been outperforming the broader market since the dot-com crash and the COVID-19 crisis accentuated the sector’s dominance. This is bifurcation in play and we expect this trend to accelerate in the post-pandemic world given structural tailwinds underpinning the sector, such as strong pricing power and improving operating costs control. Asia ex-Japan: Japan, given the relative success of the region’s containment efforts for COVID-19, we expect the region to register the fastest economic rebound post-pandemic. This is already evident in the economic surprise indices. In Asia, we stay Overweight in China and Singapore, and we add Indonesia as a beneficiary of a young population embracing the digital economy. We expect themes and sectors that possess superior secular fundamentals to sustain their outperformance. We remain constructive on North Asia e-Commerce and upstream semiconductors which are long-term beneficiaries of online retail spending, remote connectivity, cloud data access, smart devices, and the surge in visitations and airtime on social media platforms; and large China state banks. The ASEAN market is the most hit; We see attractive valuations in some countries and sectors where the balance sheet looks healthy and the recovery of revenues can be faster than others. In ASEAN, our preferred market is Indonesia and Singapore. Both still apply a partial locking and prepare to start normally again, taking into account the level of transmission and the choice between public health and economic loss. Both markets are traded at 13x price-ratio to revenue (P/E), and are the most inexpensive market in ASEAN, thus opening up space for revenue adjustments. We believe normalcy can quickly resume in Indonesia once restrictions are lifted. Essentially a self- sufficient country with a young working population, domestic consumption will continue to drive recovery. Bank Indonesia and the government have provided support with rate cuts and stimulus. Foreign investors have started to return to the country’s bond and equity markets in May. In Singapore, economic growth has been further downgraded to the -5% to -7% range for 2020 (DBSf: -5.7%). So far, the Singapore government has committed SGD92.9b – or nearly 20% of GDP – in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We believe the Straits Times Index, which has lost 22% YTD, has already priced in a lot of negatives, and investors should focus on the post-COVID recovery.  4) Overweight Gold as a risk diversifier We believe adding gold to the portfolio at current levels still makes sense for investors wanting diversification for their portfolio, especially in this heightened state of uncertainties. We see gold rising above USD1,900/oz by middle of next year.  Our pricing model for gold suggests the three most important drivers for gold price are bond yields (negative correlation), the US Dollar Index (DXY) (negative correlation), and recession risk (positive correlation). These factors have played out well except for the DXY which is still hovering around 97. Now that liquidity has appeared to be back to normal, the knock-on effect from the Fed’s stimulus may be the ample liquidity that looks for a home, just like in 2008. Gold typically responds to the notion of systemic risks evolving. The unprecedented stimulus could suggest rising inflation, debt crisis, currency crisis, or banking crisis in the making, which may threaten the global financial system. 5) Key theme New Investment Theme I - Beyond Pandemi The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we live, work, and play completely. Major post-pandemic trends like the diversification of supply chains, rise in alternative meats, more individuals adopting the work-from-home approach, as well as the accentuation of e-Commerce and e-Sports will be the key drivers of growth in the future as consumers and companies adapt to the new normal. Continuing the theme - 5G Part 2 The 5G communication standard is one of the factors that will determine who wins and who loses in the next phase of technological dominance. It is a crucial element in shaping the world of hyper-connectivity, facilitating the interlinkages of everything with everyone anytime, anywhere. 5G presents new investment opportunities in application processor manufacturers, communication integrated circuit design firms, and semiconductor supply chains.

DBS and ComfortDelgro Taxi announce strategic payments partnership,25 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_ComfortDelgro_Taxi_announce_strategic_payments_partnership, Singapore ,"- DBS and ComfortDelGro Taxi today announced that the two parties have entered into a strategic partnership to enhance payment services for their customers in Singapore. Users can now book and pay for their ComfortDelGro taxi rides directly and seamlessly through an integrated in-app booking function on DBS PayLah!, one of Singapore’s leading platform apps with over 1.7 million users. They will enjoy the same booking and payment functionalities as offered by the ComfortDelGro Taxi Booking App, and are not required to download an additional app. DBS PayLah! users can now book and pay for their ComfortDelGro taxi rides directly on the DBS PayLah! platform The announcement follows the rollout of DBS PayLah! as an in-app payment in the ComfortDelGro Taxi Booking App in March this year, where taxi passengers could select DBS PayLah! as a default QR Code payment option within the app.  Said Jeremy Soo, DBS’ Singapore Head of Consumer Banking Group, “ComfortDelGro Taxi is our first transport merchant partner to be onboarded onto the DBS PayLah! platform, joining others such as leading cinema exhibitor Golden Village and restaurant-reservation booking platform Chope. This marks a significant milestone in our journey to inject dynamism into our mobile ecosystem platform, where we leverage technology and artificial intelligence to proactively piece together individual journeys for our customers. In doing so, we can provide personalised nudges and contextualised offers which they will welcome as thoughtful reminders. “For example, when a customer has booked tickets for a movie at Golden Village in VivoCity, our intelligent banking capabilities will be able to provide a timely reminder to book a taxi through ComfortDelGro Taxi an hour before. There is still so much more we could do with technology to create a truly intuitive customer experience. To augment this, we remain firmly committed to ramping up our platform partnerships with lifestyle merchants in Singapore, so that our customers can enjoy a wider variety of goods and services through our DBS PayLah! ecosystem.” Mr Ang Wei Neng, CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi, said: “Our partnership with DBS has come a long way and our collaborations have also grown over the years. We are glad to be the first transport operator to have the ComfortDelGro Taxi Booking App integrated into DBS PayLah! as we are always looking at ways to make taxi booking services more accessible to commuters. To help stop the spread of Covid-19, we also want to encourage commuters to switch to using in-app payments such as DBS PayLah! and to book a taxi through our apps so that contract tracing is easier."" DBS and ComfortDelGro Taxi first partnered in 2017 to introduce QR code payment for taxi rides, which helped pave the way for consumers in Singapore to use QR code payments widely in everyday transactions. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, DBS recorded some 20% of QR code transactions which took place within the transport segment. Earlier in February, both parties had also collaborated on an initiative to encourage commuters to use cashless payment for street hail fares to help facilitate contact tracing during the Covid-19 situation. Customers would get SGD 2 off and a 10% admin fee waiver with their DBS/POSB Card when they pay for their taxi fares via the 'Pay for Street Hail' feature on the ComfortDelGro Taxi Booking App. As of mid-June, over 50,000 redemptions had been made. Added Soo, “We seek mutually beneficial relationships for our merchant partners in every collaboration that we do. The circuit breaker period has not been easy for most, and especially for those who work as freelancers. As services gradually resume during Phase 2 of Singapore’s reopening, we hope to help boost demand for our partners with our contextualised offers, and will double down on enabling our technology capabilities to do so.” To commemorate this launch, DBS PayLah! users can redeem up to two SGD 5 instant rebates for ComfortDelGro taxi rides taken during the months of July and August 2020. DBS will also offer taxi passengers contextual offers or rebates from other DBS PayLah! partners such as Toast Box, KFC, and Foodpanda.

Want to help others in new normal? This investment could be the answer! | Bahasa,24 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Want_to_help_others_in_new_normal_This_investment_could_be_the_answer, Indonesia ,"- Several regions in Indonesia have been transitioning from the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) to a new normal. In this new normal, financial management is increasingly important, especially in maintaining a balance between spending and saving, without neglecting the importance of investing as a strategic way to increase the benefit of saving money. The Finance Ministry's Budget Financing and Risk Management Office (DJPPR) recently issued Government Retail Bond (ORI) Series 017 online (e-SBN). The issuance of ORI017, with a three-year  maturity, is a breath of fresh air for the people. The bond offering period lasts from 15 June 2020 to 9 July 2020. People can place orders for ORI017 through distribution partners ( midis ), one of them digibank by DBS. As a pioneer of digital banking in Indonesia, digibank by DBS presents the e-SBN feature for purchases of government securities (SBN) in a process that is 100% digital, from beginning to end. As an investment instrument guaranteed by the government, ORI017 offers an opportunity in the new normal. Still in doubt? Here are the reasons how you can help others while still making money by investing in ORI017! Contribute to Covid-19 handling The Covid-19 pandemic has not only affected people financially but also the national economy. As an investment instrument designed for Indonesian citizens, the proceeds from the sale of ORI017 will be used by the government to build and restore the national economy. In one stroke, people get several benefits. A safe and anti-fraud instrument As an investment instrument that is offered and guaranteed by the government, ORI017 allows people to invest money safely with minimum risk. People lend money to the government and the government pays it back with interest on maturity date. In addition to government guarantee, ORI017 is an investment instrument that can be traded at secondary market prices past its minimum holding period on 15 September 2020. Thus, people can sell ORI017 and get their money back in an emergency. Reversely, people can earn profit if they hold the bond until maturity date. So, there is no need to worry about the fund being idle and it's not a fraud. No need for large capital People without large capital should not hesitate to invest their money. ORI017 could be the right answer for first-time investors. People can purchase ORI017 starting from IDR1 million and its multiplication thereare with a maximum ampount of purchase of IDR3 billion. Even with a small capital, people can start investing in ORI017 and still gain profit. Easy and seamless The purchasing process is one ot the things that must be considered when planning to invest money. ORI017 can be purchased online through midis in the primary market through four phases, namely registration, ordering, payment, and settlement. As one of the distribution partners of ORI017, digibank by DBS as a full-fledged digital banking service presents simplicity through the e-SBN feature with a branchless, paperless, signatureless system so that the ORI017 purchase process is fully digital, from beginning to end. Using the digibank by DBS application, people obtain a single investor identification (SID) by filling out the personal information column in the application. Their SID will be sent through email within a day. After obtaining their SID, people can register by clicking on the ‘e-SBN registration’ option in the digibank by DBS application and the ‘continue order’ option to receive a billing code. The billing code can be used to process payment using fund in the ‘digibank savings’ account. The process is complete after the State Revenue Transaction Number (NTPN) and a completed order notification is received with proof of ownership of ORI via the digibank by DBS application and email. A suitable emergency fund alternative People have different needs, purposes and personalities. Every single person has his/her own considerations regarding investment. The key factor to consider when starting an investment is the return from the risks incurred, considering that the principle of prudence must be applied. With its comparatively low risk, ORI017 offers a promising return, with a fixed coupon rate of 6.4 percent per year and a three-year maturity that ends on 15 July 2023. This makes ORI017 the right investment option, especially for purposes of emergency fund since it could be traded on the secondary market anytime, particularly in the future due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Earn more profit If there's an opportunity to make an investment more profitable, why not? By investing in ORI017, customers not only get a 6.4 percent yield but will also get extra incentives. By purchasing ORI017 via the digibank by DBS application, people can get cash rewards of up to IDR4.5 million. People also have the opportunity to get cash rewards of up to IDR3 million for purchases made after 18 June 2020.

Keppel Infrastructure Trust and Keppel Energy secure Singapore's first sustainability-linked loan in the energy sector from DBS Bank and OCBC Bank,24 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Keppel_Infrastructure_Trust_and_Keppel_Energy_secure_Singapores_first_sustainability_linked_loan_in_the_energy_sector_from_DBS_Bank_and_OCBC_Bank, Singapore ,"- Keppel Infrastructure Trust (“KIT”) and Keppel Energy Pte. Ltd. (“KE”), through a joint venture [1] , have secured a 7-year S$700 million sustainability-linked loan from DBS Bank and OCBC Bank for its jointly owned gas-fired co-generation plant, Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant. Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant One of the largest sustainability-linked loans in Singapore, the transaction also marks KIT and KE’s maiden sustainability-linked loan and is the first such loan for Singapore’s energy sector to date. DBS Bank and OCBC Bank acted as joint lenders and sustainability coordinators for this transaction. The loan is linked to carbon emission targets for Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant. These targets include benchmarking of the plant’s carbon emissions intensity against national indices, as well as demonstrating continuous improvement in the plant’s carbon emissions intensity. If these pre-set targets are met, the interest rate on the facility will be subsequently reduced on a tiered basis. This strengthens KIT’s sustainability efforts, where many of the Trust’s businesses and assets across its portfolio have already incorporated best-in-class technologies to support sustainable urban infrastructure. Key initiatives include the implementation of a water management plan at City Gas that reduced water consumption by up to 13% in 2019, the introduction of the use of drones for equipment inspection at selected Ixom HoldCo Pty Ltd (Ixom) facilities, improving efficiency and safety levels, and the development of a smart chemical handling system at Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant, which reduced staff exposure to chemicals. Mr Matthew Pollard, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure Fund Management, the Trustee-Manager of KIT, said, “Sustainability is an essential part of the Trust’s strategy and operations. Beyond adopting high environmental, health and safety standards for the businesses and assets in our portfolio, we are also strengthening our commitment to sustainability through financing. This loan facility will help us to proactively drive best-in-class practices and support the performance of Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant as we build a sustainable future together with our stakeholders.” Ms Janice Bong, General Manager (Energy Infrastructure) of Keppel Infrastructure, the parent company of KE, said, “Keppel is committed to reducing our environmental impact by focusing on enhancing efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of our operations. As owners and operators of Keppel Merlimau Cogen, we are constantly looking for ways to optimise operations so that the plant minimises its carbon emissions, while ensuring reliable power generation for Singaporeans.” Ms Elaine Lam, Head, Global Corporate Banking, OCBC Bank, said, “We are proud to support Keppel Infrastructure Trust and Keppel Energy on its maiden sustainability-linked loan, which is ground-breaking on many fronts. Not only is it one of the largest sustainability-linked loan to date, but it is also the first for Singapore’s energy sector. We are excited by the growing interest in sustainable finance from increasingly diverse industries. With Keppel Infrastructure Trust’s strong leadership in the energy sector and commitment to continuously improve the efficiency of their existing infrastructure, we are confident that this transaction will pave the way for more energy players to step forward.” Mr Hong Teck Khiam, Head of Power and Utilities, Institutional Banking, DBS Bank, said, “With responsible banking as one of the key tenets of our sustainability strategy, DBS is heartened to support Keppel Infrastructure Trust and Keppel Energy in this landmark transaction which demonstrates the Singapore energy sector’s transition towards a low-carbon economy. The transaction also marks an important step towards building a clean, affordable and reliable energy future in Singapore by providing interest savings when pre-agreed ESG targets are met, while financing the development and implementation of less carbon intensive energy solutions.” The above transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the net tangible assets or earnings per share of Keppel Corporation Limited and Keppel Infrastructure Trust for the current financial year. [1] The joint venture is Keppel Merlimau Cogen Pte Ltd, which is owned by KIT and Keppel Energy Pte. Ltd. in the proportion of 51% and 49% respectively.

DBS first Singapore company to clinch global digital transformation award,21 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_Singapore_company_to_clinch_global_digital_transformation_award, Singapore ,"- DBS announced today that it has been named the inaugural winner of the Digital Transformation Award in the Hackett Group’s Digital Awards 2020. The bank was also a Finalist in the ‘Automation – Artificial Intelligence’ category, for its Joy Corporate Banking Chat Bot. This is the first time that a Singapore company has been recognised in the Hackett Group’s awards. In awarding DBS with the Digital Transformation Award, the Hackett Group noted how the bank has set out to address the radical shift in banking in the digital age by transforming multiple aspects of its business, using a range of automation, analytics and Artificial Intelligence technologies. Hackett highlighted how these efforts have proven particularly invaluable with the onset of the global Covid-19 pandemic, as the bank managed to leverage its Analytics-Based Operations Resource Management (ORM) tool to model various operational scenarios and enable more efficient capacity planning. Through the simulation capability of the ORM tool, the bank was able to obtain additional insights on number of staff required for optimal efficiency, and suggested overtime hours in order to support volume spikes in various business areas. One area in which this was applied was in SME Operations. As a result, the bank was able to avail more than $1.1 billion in loans to micro- and small-enterprise customers during the pandemic, even as more than 80% of the bank’s staff worked from home. Simulations from the ORM tool also helped DBS’ securities operations team to quickly adjust its manpower resource planning during the pandemic. This enabled it to process 60% more equity transactions in April and May 2020, without any compromise in accuracy or timeliness, even as global markets entered the most volatile period in recent history. Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Bank, said, “Covid-19 has demonstrated the value of our digitalisation efforts, both in respect of customers as well as employees. For our customers, our digital onboarding and transaction capabilities allowed easy access across products such as payments, trade, equity trading and investing. This resulted in above market increases in volumes and allowed us to be the principal channel for the government to activate several relief programmes. For employees, easy remote working, AI-driven contact tracing and sensor-led social distancing created safety and trust. We hope to retain our leadership in these areas in a post-Covid world.” Headquartered in the USA, The Hackett Group is an intellectual property-based strategic consultancy and leading benchmarking and best practices firm to global companies, with offerings that include smart automation and enterprise cloud application implementation. Past winners of the Hackett Digital Awards have included Bayer, IBM, HP and Shell. The accolades from The Hackett Group follow DBS’ recent naming to Forbes’ 2020 list of World’s Best Banks. Based on Forbes’ survey of more than 40,000 banking customers worldwide, DBS placed first out of the 29 domestic and international banks ranked in India, and second out of the 15 ranked in Indonesia.

DBS sows the seeds for a new generation of citizen farmers with Singapore’s first community farm in a bank,17 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_sows_the_seeds_for_a_new_generation_of_citizen_farmers_with_Singapores_first_community_farm_in_a_bank, Singapore ,"- With interest around community farming growing amid recent calls to strengthen Singapore’s food security networks, DBS today announced plans to transform a patch of outdoor space at its DBS Asia Hub building in Changi Business Park into what is believed to be Singapore’s first community farm located in a bank. In doing so, the bank hopes to create accessible, hands-on farming opportunities at the workplace and help nurture a new crop of citizen farmers among its employees. Dubbed the DBS Food Forest, the community farm was conceptualised in partnership with Edible Garden City, a social enterprise supported by DBS Foundation that has developed over 240 food gardens over the past seven years. Currently scheduled for completion by the end of 2020, the Food Forest is expected to sustain over 50 varieties of edible plants and herbs that Singaporeans consume every day. They range from vegetables such as sweet potato leaves and watercress, to fruits such as papaya, starfruit and calamansi, and herbs such as galangal, lemongrass and laksa leaves. Bringing the farm-to-table concept into the workplace, DBS plans to work with DBS Asia Hub’s in-house cafeteria whose chefs will turn the harvests from the Food Forest into freshly-cooked meals for the bank’s employees. Having a supply of produce close by also reduces the number of trips that suppliers need to make to deliver ingredients to DBS premises. This not only helps reduce transport costs, but also contributes towards the lowering of carbon emissions. In line with the bank’s vision of a future with zero food waste, the Food Forest will also include an on-site composting system, which will convert organic waste generated by the in-house cafeteria into organic fertiliser. This is then used to enrich the soil of the Food Forest for the next harvest, completing the cycle from crop to compost. For a start, compost derived from coffee grounds that the bank collected at last year’s Singapore FinTech Festival will be used to fertilise the soil of the Food Forest when it first opens. This is an extension of DBS’ current practice of using coffee grounds from its in-house cafes as fertiliser for all greenery in its premises. The Food Forest will be tended by the bank’s own employees, who will be involved in activities such as weeding, maintenance and harvesting. They will be supported by experts from Edible Garden City. Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Head, shared that while DBS has supported the development of sustainable food systems as part of its approach to responsible banking, the Covid-19 situation has led to a greater appreciation of the need to optimise our resources to enhance food security. The DBS Food Forest ticked all the right boxes for the bank, in terms of sustainability, responsible business practices, green design, employee engagement, as well as the productive use of space. “By bringing food production right to the workplace, we hope to get our employees interested enough in urban farming to be involved in one of the more than 1,500 community gardens [1] across our housing estates, or to even try their hand at growing small batches of crops in their own home. Our aim is to spark a virtuous circle, with our employees positively influencing their families and friends, which in turn leads to more edible gardens blooming across the island. We believe that small steps can make a big difference, and we want to spark change by raising the community’s awareness of the amount of effort needed to grow what we eat, and ultimately foster a more mindful approach towards food.” Additionally, the Food Forest will include many carbon and resource-conserving features. For instance, waste wood chips and shavings will be compacted into ‘bricks’ to line the footpaths in the Food Forest. A water-efficient drip irrigation system will be deployed to keep plants hydrated, with an automatic timer attached to the water source to prevent unnecessary watering and wastage. Going forward, DBS plans to propagate more such community farms across its various office locations in Singapore and in the region, building on the learnings gleaned from developing and managing the Food Forest in Singapore. Samuell Ang, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden City, said, “DBS has been a longstanding partner in our growth, and we’re pleased to be able to work with the bank in bringing their very first community farm to life. Community farms are a vital touchpoint for the public to learn more about farming and to get involved in growing their own food. While they are increasingly common in housing estates and shopping malls, it’s not often you find one in a commercial space. We hope that more businesses and developers will be inspired by DBS’ efforts, and that in the near future we can see similar farms blossoming across commercial properties and business parks.” Loh Lay Kwan, Vice President for Sustainable Operations at DBS, has been finding her green thumb now that she has been spending more time at home amid Covid-19. Over the past few months, she has grown kangkong and various herbs right from her balcony and is looking forward to working on the Food Forest in her spare time when the pandemic situation improves. “I find gardening to be very therapeutic, and it gives me a sense of calm with everything going on in the world today. With the Food Forest, I will be able to literally put food on the table by doing something I enjoy, and I find that to be really meaningful. I’ve not tried growing such a wide range of fruit and vegetables before so this will certainly be a new and exciting experience!” [1] Source – National Parks Board [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS and Lions Befrienders partner to launch Singapore's largest-ever virtual befriending initiative,14 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Lions_Befrienders_partner_to_launch_Singapores_largest_ever_virtual_befriending_initiative, Singapore ,"- To help tackle social isolation and loneliness among seniors in Singapore, DBS and Lions Befrienders (LB) have joined hands to roll out Singapore’s largest-ever virtual befriending volunteer initiative – LB Virtual Befriending@ SAC (Senior Activity Centre). 1,000 DBS employees will engage 1,000 senior beneficiaries in July and August 2020 through virtual conversations, sing-along sessions, simple home gardening projects, as well as online games. The official launch of this programme is a successful culmination of pilot sessions run by both organisations since early June [1] to positive response from seniors and volunteers. The initiative paves the way for the future of volunteerism by allowing LB to unlock more high-quality volunteer engagements and widens LB’s potential pool of volunteers by enabling more people – including those with mobility issues, transport issues, who are immuno-compromised or those who simply have little time to spare – to connect with beneficiaries remotely. Lions Befrienders senior interacting with DBS volunteers virtually This timely programme will help alleviate the ill-effects of social isolation faced by some 6,000 at-risk seniors served by LB, who mostly live in rental flats and are on financial assistance schemes. In recent months, LB has observed that safe distancing measures implemented to counter the spread of Covid-19 may have contributed to the increasing social isolation experienced by these seniors. Since February, LB has conducted twice weekly check-in calls following the cessation of activities at SACs and noticed a gradual decline in the seniors’ emotional and mental health. During the eight-week ‘Circuit Breaker’ period, LB was alerted to four attempted suicides among their seniors – up from the average of one attempted suicide every three to six months prior to Covid-19. Despite the recent reopening of nine SACs, LB continues to face challenges in giving visiting seniors the full attention they require, due to constraints on the number of on-site staff. Said Mr Anthony Tay, Chairman, Lions Befrienders, “While we have reopened our doors, we found that our seniors long for human interaction more than anything else, especially when socialising is currently not encouraged. This LB Virtual Befriending@ SAC programme adds a bright spot to their day and gives them a sense of purpose as they embrace and adopt technology into their lives. We plan to continue to grow and expand the virtual befriending programme even after the guidelines on social distancing are relaxed.” Said Mr Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Head, “We can all empathise with the emotional impact of social isolation. Pre-Covid, this was something that many seniors in Singapore had already been experiencing involuntarily, and the lack of online access or smart devices among seniors is now making it even more challenging for them to connect with others. We are glad to continue our long-running outreach efforts with LB through our People of Purpose volunteer movement, to ensure that the seniors who have been pivotal in building our nation are not neglected during these trying times. We are also excited to be part of a ground-breaking volunteerism initiative that unlocks new ways to help our seniors, and enables more volunteers from all walks of life to connect with beneficiaries remotely. Our hope is this initiative will go on to catalyse greater societal awareness around at-risk seniors and action among fellow Singaporeans.” How LB Virtual Befriending@ SAC works The purpose of LB Virtual Befriending@ SAC is three-fold: Firstly, the provision of dedicated attention is important to helping at-risk seniors ease the feelings of loneliness and social isolation. The programme also enables seniors to stay connected and build friendships, especially during this difficult period. Secondly, this period serves as a window of opportunity for seniors to adopt modern technology, as they have been more open to taking up new skills in order to continue engaging with others online. In the past, the ability to interact with others physically took precedence over the need to learn and use technology. Thirdly, introducing new activities such as home gardening and cognitive games including chess and othello, which are considered time-consuming and challenging to roll out in larger groups, can now be implemented easily via this programme. These activities are proven to help improve motor skills and cognition among the elderly. In a typical session, a senior would be paired with up to two DBS volunteers, where they would interact with each other in an hour-long session via video conferencing tools such as Webex and Zoom on tablet computers provided to the seniors at LB centres. Some of these pilot virtual interactions have uncovered the seniors’ hidden talents and deepened intergenerational bonding – for instance, DBS volunteers were treated to a rare performance by a former Chinese opera singer who sang a few lines of classical Chinese opera, which is becoming a lost art today. This large-scale virtual befriending programme is a continuation of DBS’ initiatives to serve LB’s seniors over the past five years. Since 2015, more than 3,600 DBS volunteers have put in over 17,000 hours to reach out to 3,000 seniors via activities such as grocery shopping and board game sessions. In addition to mobilising 1,000 DBS employees as volunteers for this initiative, the bank will donate 40 tablets for LB’s use. Ms Tan Suan Heok, Senior Vice President at DBS’ Technology & Operations, is an active DBS volunteer with Lions Befrienders since 2015. Together with a team of volunteer leads, she has galvanised more than 200 colleagues to participate in volunteer activities each year. “Over the years, my colleagues and I have developed strong friendships with the seniors at Lions Befrienders, simply by lending them a listening ear and bringing them out for fun activities that they enjoy,” she said. “With safe distancing measures in place, such activities are on pause. I'm glad that this initiative still allows us to interact with our senior friends online. Those of us at DBS who have been part of this pilot have really enjoyed chatting and playing games with the seniors virtually, as it helps to make up for the lack of physical interaction. At the end of the day, what matters is that we can be there for them to help make them feel less alone.” DBS has been actively involved in wide-ranging initiatives – both community and bank-led – that support the elderly segment in Singapore. These include advocating for active ageing, running digital literacy workshops for seniors, and providing them job opportunities. Since 2009, about 80 seniors have been hired and trained as “digital ambassadors” as part of the POSB Active Neighbours programme, to assist peers in digital banking services at branches. In April 2020, DBS launched its SGD 10.5 million DBS Stronger Together Fund to help communities hard hit by Covid-19 across the region. As part of the initiative, DBS is partnering The Food Bank Singapore and ItsRainingRaincoats to distribute up to 700,000 meals to underserved segments in Singapore, including the elderly, low-income and migrant workers, with the support of employees and fellow Singaporeans.

Surviving amid the Covid-19-induced crisis | Bahasa,09 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Surviving_amid_the_Covid_19_induced_crisis, Indonesia ,"- Indonesia’s economy only grew 2.97 percent in the first quarter of 2020. The next quarter is expected to see significant challenges. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed global order dramatically. The spread of the virus is not just a health issue as it has also paralyzed the global economy. Offices, factories, and shopping centers are closed and most of the public transport systems have shut down. As a result, many companies have reduced the number of employees. The global financial crisis is already here. Under the assumption that the pandemic will peak in the second quarter before receding in the second half of 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the global economy will shrink and contract to -3 percent. The IMF’s projection is far below last year’s economic growth of 2.9 percent. The figures – which appeared in the “World Economic Outlook” published by the IMF on April 13 – indicate the worst economic downturn since “The Great Depression” that hit the world in 1929 and the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. During the 2008 financial crisis, the global economy shrunk to -0.1 percent. Advanced economies such as the United States and European countries were the hardest hit by this pandemic. There are concerns that the economic condition could worsen even further due to high uncertainty. “There is extreme uncertainty around the global economic growth forecast,” wrote the IMF in the report. If the peak and turning point of the pandemic occur later then predicted, the global economy will sink even deeper. According to the IMF, the economic impact depends on factors that are difficult to predict, such as the virus epidemiology, the effectiveness of social/physical restrictions, as well as the development of treatment and discovery of vaccines. In addition, countries across the globe are increasingly under pressure from a health and financial crisis, and as well as a plunge in commodity prices. Even when the pandemic ends, the global economic landscape is no longer the same. The impact of the pandemic is worse than the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. Global losses can exceed US$9 trillion or more than 10 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The economic paralysis that started in China has spread to nearly all countries in the world. With the disruptions in the supply chain, factory shutdowns and workers being quarantined, levels of consumption and shopping have also dropped, causing global trade activity to slow dramatically. The current financial crisis is far different from the crisis in 1998 and 2008 in terms of causes and impacts. During the 1998 financial crisis, the value of the rupiah against the US dollar plunged from Rp2,000 to Rp15,000 per dollar. Rupiah depreciation hurt large companies and financial institutions with large amounts of dollar debts. At the time, it was small businesses that sustained Indonesia’s economy because they did not have dollar debts. They were able to survive by relying on domestic market demand. Moreover, the size of the domestic market enabled Indonesia to survive from the 2008 financial crisis that was triggered by the collapse of the US subprime mortgages. The two financial crises helped make the Indonesian Government better prepared to face the economic slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Bank Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority (OJK), and Indonesian banks have also have prepared protocols for dealing with the impacts of the pandemic. Indonesia’s banking system today is far healthier and stronger compared to the 1998 crisis. This is indicated by the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and non-performing loan (NPL) ratio that stood at 21.77 percent and 2.77 percent as of March 2020, respectively. The problem is that the current financial crisis has hit the entire economy. Both large companies and micro and small businesses are not immune to the impacts of the pandemic. All economic activities have been halted. The level of public consumption, usually the driving force of the economy, has continued to decline. When economic activities ground to a halt, stakeholders are obliged to ensure that all citizens meet their daily needs. Several countries have launched fiscal stimuli to save the domestic economy and prevent it from sinking even deeper as the pandemic has weakened the economy. According to Kompas , about 183 countries have launched extensive stimulus programs to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy. These stimuli include tax incentives, social safety nets, loan guarantees, lower interest rates, and quantitative easing. Indonesia has taken a similar measure. The government has launched a third stimulus package worth IDR405.1 trillion to fight Covid-19. The amount made up 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). The stimulus includes a health budget of IDR75 trillion, social security (IDR10 trillion), support for industry (IDR 70.1 trillion), and an economic recovery program (IDR150 trillion). Despite the large amount of stimulus, Fiscal Policy Office Head Febrio Kacaribu doubted the fund was sufficient. “Honestly, we doubt it will be enough. The government will be prepared in case it is not sufficient, what to be done, as what we see are quite worrying,” Febrio said in a video conference in Jakarta on Monday (20/4). To anticipate budget needs for Covid-19 handling, the Ministry of Finance has entered into a negotiation with the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). “A Covid-19 emergency fund of between US$200-250 million from IsDB is being negotiated,” Sri Mulyani wrote on her official Instagram account after holding a video conference with IsDB, Katadata.co.id reported on Monday (27/4). Sri Mulyani said that IsDB’s support is the result of collaboration with the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). IsDB will disburse the fund through the 3R (Response, Restore, Restart) programme. Sri Mulyani also briefed IsDB President Bandar Hajjar about the Indonesian government’s policy measures for Covid-19 handling. Stimuli and Indonesia’s Economic Growth The stimuli launched by a number of countries and the Indonesian Government to keep the economy rolling are considered positive by Bank DBS analysts in “DBS Asian Insights Report”. “Putting aside concerns about fiscal discipline and debt burdens, financial authorities across the world are allowing their budget deficit to widen considerably,” DBS said in the “DBS Asian Insights Report” entitled Hedge the Wave, published on April 13. Although the stimulus is considered positive, the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted the Indonesian Government to maneuver to secure the state budget. On the other hand, the quarantine (lockdown) policy has hurt many companies, causing a sharp decline in government revenues. However, the government needs to increase spending to deal with Covid-19 transmissions, provide social safety net, tax stimulus for businesses that have been hit by the crisis, and other supporting measures. Signs of the current tough times were already apparent in early 2020. Statistics Indonesia’s data showed that Indonesia’s economy only grew 2.97 percent in the first quarter of 2020, much lower than Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani’s projection of 4.6 percent. Sri Mulyani expected the economy to decline further in the second quarter due to the impact of social distancing to break the chain of Covid-19 transmissions. “We expect a further decline in the second quarter due to the expansion of PSBB beyond Jabodetabek,” Sri Mulyani said in a working meeting with House Commission XI through a video conference in Jakarta on Wednesday (6/5). She admitted that she was shocked by economic growth realization in the first quarter, which was far below expectations. This year, Indonesians are expected to focus spending on staple goods while keeping non-priority spending in check. This will help maintain spending on food and beverages, restaurants and health services, which account for 44 percent of the total household consumption. However, President Joko Widodo believed that Indonesia’s economic growth is better compared to other Covid-19-hit countries. Jokowi cited as an example China’s economic growth in the first quarter of 2020, which was -6.8 percent, a plunge from the previous growth rate of 6 percent. Thus, China’s economic performance declined by a total of 12.8 percent. Apart from China, France, one of the countries hardest hit by Covid-19, has seen its economy declining by 6.25 percent. Hong Kong suffered a 5.9 percent decline. “Spain fell by 5.88 percent and Italy by 4.95 percent. The economic performance of our country is still relatively good,” said Jokowi when opening a Cabinet meeting via video conference on May 6.

"DBS beefs up support for social enterprises with cashflow support, skills training amid Covid-19",08 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_beefs_up_support_for_social_enterprises_with_cashflow_support_skills_training_amid_Covid_19, Singapore ,"- Recognising the important role that social enterprises (SEs) play in creating positive impact in society – whether by hiring disadvantaged members of society or solving societal problems – DBS today announced a slew of proactive measures to beef up support for this sector. They include a working capital loan at preferential interest rates, grant offerings, access to business and digital transformation courses, and a business resource guide for SEs to tap into. DBS is boosting its support for social enterprises such as Boxgreen to help protect jobs and alleviate cashflow woes amid Covid-19. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS and Board Member of DBS Foundation said that the financial needs of SEs who have a positive impact on at least 126,000 [1] beneficiaries in Singapore, are often overlooked by lenders as they usually do not have a borrowing history with banks or the relevant credit profiles. As a result, access to working capital to keep their business afloat may be even more difficult during the present Covid-19 economic downturn. “The business community in Singapore has been buffeted by Covid-19. To fulfil their social and business mission, SEs are working harder than ever during this period to protect jobs and do their part for society. As a bank that has contributed to the development of Singapore, it is necessary for us to stand by these SEs by providing them with timely and affordable access not just to funding but also to the bank’s expertise in business and digital transformation.” Availing affordable interest rates and providing fast access to working capital To help SEs protect jobs and alleviate cashflow pressures amid these difficult times, DBS is making available the collateral-free SE Digital Business Loan to all 360 raiSE-registered SEs [2] at an interest rate as low as 2% per annum [3] . This makes it the lowest interest-rate loan offered to SEs during this period. Through the SE Digital Business Loan, SEs will be able to receive up to SGD200,000 in funding as quickly as five days after they sign and accept their letter of offer as DBS recognises that timely access to funding is most important when keeping a business afloat. Understanding the manpower crunch that SEs face, DBS has also simplified the loan application process to the SE Digital Business Loan to relieve SEs of the onerous task of submitting audited financial statements. Instead, credit assessment processes have been streamlined and SEs need only provide their most recent bank statement or Notice of Assessment for their application to be processed [4] . The application process is completely contact-free and digital. The SE Digital Business Loan also comes bundled with complimentary loan replacement insurance which takes the financial strain off an SE in the event of unexpected circumstances, such as accidental death or accidental permanent disability. Loan processing fees usually pegged at SGD 500 or 2% of the approved loan amount will also be absorbed by the bank. DBS Foundation Business Transformation and Improvement (BTI) Grant  The DBS Foundation has set aside SGD 500,000 in the DBS Foundation BTI Grant to tide SEs through these tough times. The Grant is open to 60 DBS Foundation-supported SEs across Asia, and is in addition to the annual DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant which has already provided more than SGD 5 million in funding to over 100 SEs in the past five years. The purpose of DBS Foundation’s BTI Grant is two-fold: to provide funding support to SEs so that they can protect and create jobs, as well as pivot digitally in search of new income streams to transform their business operations, ultimately empowering them to continue serving their beneficiaries and the wider community. In the last few weeks, 13 Singapore-based SEs from a myriad of industries that provide employment to a total of 2,500 people and support more than 100,000 beneficiaries have already applied for the grant. The top reasons for applying for the BTI grant were to implement business solutions to: Fund the expansion of enhanced caregiving and medical services to the elderly and other sectors of society who are vulnerable to Covid-19; Provide employment for the disadvantaged and marginalised. In addition to funding, grant awardees will benefit from DBS Foundation’s SE support network which includes mentorship, business networking and matchmaking opportunities with the bank’s clients and fellow SEs. SEs can also tap into the bank’s complimentary webinars and online courses to further ease them into the world of digital banking. Throughout the next few months, they can sign up [5] to be trained on how they can transact, trade and manage their banking needs from the comfort of their home offices. In addition, DBS is also equipping all SEs with a complimentary Covid-19 Business Resource Guide to give SE business owners the insights needed to navigate their businesses through the current economic uncertainty. The guide will contain fresh perspectives from industry leaders on how the operating landscape is likely to change as a result of Covid-19, and actionable tips for SEs to position themselves for recovery and growth as economies in the region look towards a gradual restart. The guide will be available from mid-June onwards. Social enterprise Boxgreen, which specialises in producing and delivering healthy snacks, recently secured a working capital loan from DBS. Walter Oh, Co-Founder, Boxgreen said, “At the onset of the virus outbreak, the first thing on our minds was to retain jobs and make sure that our employees’ livelihoods would not be affected in a big way. We have more than 30 staff, who include seniors, the disadvantaged and ex-offenders, who are amongst the most vulnerable in our community during Covid-19. The loan from DBS was very timely in helping to ensure the cashflow needed to continue our operations, as well as retain and upskill all our staff. With the help of DBS’ SME banking team, we are now able to stabilise and even grow the company as there is an increasing demand for healthy snacks as more people work from home and shop online.” “With the cashflow injection, we can now afford to hire more staff such as warehouse and production assistants. We count ourselves fortunate to be backed by DBS who has availed more than just financial solutions to us. Besides timely access to working capital, we’ve also been in touch with DBS Foundation and DBS’ human resources team to tap into their best practices on how to help our staff stay strong and focused during this challenging time.” Alfie Othman, CEO, Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise, raiSE said, “We recognise that any aid extended to businesses to ease the strain on cashflow will keep them operational for a longer time, thus giving them the much needed runway to bounce back and retain jobs in the process. In addition to our support, favourable loan terms from DBS Bank will give social enterprises the cashflow options they can consider, as their founders endeavour to save jobs.” Tee added, “These are unprecedented times for all, and as the economy goes through a prolonged period of uncertainty, more than ever, SEs have a pivotal role to play in strengthening our societal bonds. As a bank that has supported the growth and development of many homegrown businesses since Singapore’s independence, we want to also lend the same support and expertise to SEs who are working hard to make a difference in society.” [1] Source - https://www.raise.sg/ar2018.html/ [2] Source - h ttps://www.raise.sg/ar2018.html/ [3] Subject to eligibility; terms and conditions also apply [4] Customers with complete loan applications and full documentation submitted together with their loan application forms can expect to receive working capital monies within five working days of acceptance [5] SEs can sign-up for courses at https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/day-to-day/ways-to-bank/online-banking-ideal/dbs-ideal-customer-trainings [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS Hong Kong changes face of retirement with Face Your Future innovation | 繁體,08 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Hong_Kong_changes_face_of_retirement_with_Face_Your_Future_innovation, Hong Kong ,"- With evolving lifestyles, growing awareness of health and fitness, and medical advancement enabling more people to live longer, retirement will increasingly require a bigger and more stable nest egg. To help people better understand their retirement needs and plan for their golden years, DBS Hong Kong today announced the launch of Face Your Future, a first-of-its-kind innovative experience to raise awareness of the importance of retirement planning. “Planning for the future and retirement is never easy, and is even more challenging given the current uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. As life expectancy increases, and lifestyle needs change, it is important to know how to finance for a longer life. Through Face Your Future, we hope to provide people with a better understanding of their retirement needs, so they can look forward to their future with confidence and peace of mind,” Ajay Mathur, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group and Wealth Management, Hong Kong, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong), said.

DBS survey reveals Government-assisted financing schemes paying off; proportion of SMEs flagging cash flow as top concern more than halves since February 2020,05 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_survey_reveals_Government_assisted_financing_schemes_paying_off_proportion_of_SMEs_flagging_cash_flow_as_top_concern_more_than_halves_since_February_2020, Singapore ,"- A DBS survey signalled that the Singapore Government’s relief measures are paying off, with only three in ten SMEs now flagging cash flow concerns as a top priority, compared to over seven in ten when the same question was asked in early February as the Covid-19 situation began unfolding. DBS’ SME Pulse Check Survey showed that eight in ten SMEs are starting to think beyond their own business and be more sensitive to the needs of the wider community. Koufu is one of 23 SMEs and social enterprises in the F&B sector that DBS is partnering to provide some 400,000 meals to the elderly and low-income in Singapore during this time of economic uncertainty. (photo credit: Koufu) This 40-percentage point drop indicates that the combined efforts of the Government and financial institutions in supporting SMEs in their working capital needs are bearing fruit, giving SMEs much-needed relief from intense cashflow pressures that they would otherwise be facing. When asked what their most immediate priority was, medium-sized SMEs [1] seemed most bullish, with one in two responding that creating new revenue streams to capture growth opportunities would be their focus coming out of the extended circuit breaker period. Small SMEs [2] ranked access to working capital to keep their businesses afloat and exploring and creating new income streams as equally important. These sentiments were reflected in the DBS SME Pulse Check Survey which the bank conducted with over 300 SMEs in Singapore in the last week of the extended Circuit Breaker period in end-May. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS, shared that such trends provide useful insights to both financial institutions and policymakers on what needs to be done to continue supporting the SME community. “Availing working capital support to viable SMEs continues to be important, but that alone is insufficient in preparing our SMEs for the road ahead. With SMEs starting to focus on building new income streams, banks, industry associations and the Government can step up by offering innovative solutions for our local enterprises to identify and create new revenue opportunities. In doing so, we are helping our SMEs become more resilient so that they are better prepared to ride through the oncoming economic headwinds.” SMEs surveyed were also hopeful for further financial relief from the Government to help them cope with the ongoing crisis, with about 65% flagging that the Government should continue to provide additional support in the form of cash flow relief, tax relief or additional grants. In preparing for future growth opportunities, digital transformation and workforce upskilling rank among lowest priorities – even as SMEs take first steps in digitalising amid Covid-19 Despite repeated emphasis on the importance of preparing for a digital economy and skills upgrading to survive in the post Covid-19 economy, SMEs surveyed ranked digital transformation and workforce upskilling among their lowest priorities. Just over 10% indicated that digital transformation would be an immediate focus. However, this could be an indication that SMEs have already started their digital transformation projects amid the extended Covid-19 circuit-breaker period to optimise processes and reach out to a growing online consumer base. When asked what was holding them back from prioritising their digital journeys, close to half of SMEs surveyed shared that insufficient knowledge of the digital solutions available, a poor understanding of the benefits of going digital, and inadequate employee capabilities were the top reasons hindering their digital transformation efforts. That said, some 15% want banks to provide more advisory services on digital transformation, hinting at a degree of openness among SMEs to continue transforming their businesses digitally. However, recognising that digital transformation is a long-term journey that requires ongoing effort, commitment and investment, DBS has been proactively working with Government agencies and industry associations to maintain the current digital transformation momentum. Some recent examples include: In May 2020, DBS launched Singapore’s first cashless purchasing card for the logistics sector, eliminating the need for cash-based payments and collections at logistics depots, and helping to jumpstart the industry’s digital transformation. In March 2020, DBS introduced the F&B Digital Relief Package to enable F&B establishments to build a digital presence and create new income streams online in as fast as three days. In January 2020, DBS launched an industry-first solution to digitalise the largely cash and paper-based B2B payments and collections landscape for businesses in Singapore. DBS has also been helping to ease SMEs into adopting digital banking habits while making banking safer. In April 2020, the number of new signups for IDEAL, DBS’ online corporate banking platform, saw a double-digit increase year-on-year, while the number of conversions from branch banking to digital banking tripled. At the same time, workforce upskilling was ranked as one of SMEs’ lowest priorities, with only 3% of respondents flagging this as an immediate focus. To nudge SMEs to upskill their employees, DBS has brought its popular DBS Academy [3] online so that SMEs can easily access free bite-sized training sessions run by industry practitioners from the comfort of home. DBS is also working with industry partners and Government agencies to roll out a series of webinars on the capabilities SMEs will require in the post Covid-19 economy, as well as avenues for SMEs to send their employees for more in-depth training. SMEs keen on making a positive difference to the community beyond their business A silver lining that has emerged from the extended Circuit Breaker period is that eight in ten SMEs are now starting to think beyond their own business and to be more sensitive to the needs of the wider community. Half of this group were also open to tapping on opportunities created by DBS to give back. DBS has started partnering its SMEs to give back during this time of economic uncertainty. The bank is currently working with 23 of its SMEs and social enterprises in the F&B sector to provide some 400,000 meals to the elderly and low-income in Singapore. In doing so, SMEs are able to make a real difference to the lives of those who need a helping hand, even as DBS provides much-needed support to its clients in the F&B sector. Tee added, “It is encouraging to learn that so many of our SMEs share DBS’ commitment to be an organisation of purpose and are consciously thinking of how they can make a positive impact on society. Going forward, we will be ramping up our efforts to introduce more creative opportunities to partner SMEs in giving back to the community.” Pang Lim, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Koufu, said, “As a longstanding client of DBS, Koufu is pleased to participate in DBS’ efforts to help the more vulnerable communities in Singapore impacted by the Covid-19 situation. This is in line with Koufu’s belief in creating positive impact on society, which is especially important during this challenging period, when now, more than ever, we need to stay united. We also appreciate how DBS has taken a win-win approach by driving business back to the F&B sector, which has been hit hard by Covid-19, while giving back to the community at the same time.” [1] DBS defines SMEs with annual revenue above SGD 20 million as ‘medium-sized’ [2] DBS defines SMEs with annual revenue of between SGD 1 million and SGD 20 million as ‘small-sized’ [3] DBS’ SME Academy facilitated learning for over 1,500 SMEs across the region in 2019.

Temasek Foundation joins hands with Bank DBS Indonesia to provide food aid to daily wage workers and people affected by COVID-19 pandemic | Bahasa,05 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Temasek_Foundation_joins_hands_with_Bank_DBS_Indonesia_to_provide_food_aid_to_daily_wage_workers_and_people_affected_by_COVID_19_pandemic, Indonesia ,"- Temasek Foundation (TF) is partnering with Bank DBS Indonesia to provide meal packages for daily wage workers and people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to meet their daily needs. The symbolic handover of assistance from Temasek Foundation and DBS Indonesia on 4 June 2020 through video conference was witnessed by the Embassy of Singapore. The aid will be channeled through Foodbank of Indonesia (FOI) and the Confederation of All Indonesian Trade Union (KSBSI). The aid consists of 3,700 meal packages, distributed through FOI, and 1,400 staple needs packages, equivalent to more than 66,000 meal packages, distributed through the KSBSI. The aid will be distributed in Jakarta and West Java provinces. ""These are difficult times. It is more important now than ever for countries, societies, and communities to pull together to overcome the common challenges posed by COVID-19. In this context, this collaboration between TF and DBS Indonesia brings together two entities that each have a very commendable track record of actively working with communities in Indonesia. Today’s contributions from TF and DBS Indonesia also exemplifies the gotong royong spirit, and will complement efforts by other businesses and community organisations in Indonesia, including those with links to Singapore, to help Indonesians affected by COVID-19,"" said Ambassador of the Republic of Singapore to Indonesia H.E Anil Kumar Nayar. The collaboration between Bank DBS Indonesia and various parties is expected to encourage other parties to step forward to help people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""DBS Group’s 'Stronger Together' spirit was translated through mutual cooperation and sharing to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, let’s donate to daily wage workers who are facing severe challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia, Paulus Sutisna. ""In such uncertain times, we need to stay united and work together to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to emerge stronger. We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with Bank DBS Indonesia, Foodbank of Indonesia, and the Confederation of All Indonesian Trade Union on this meaningful programme, and we hope our collective efforts can go some way to ease the burden of communities going through difficult times,"" said Temasek Foundation International Chief Executive Benedict Cheong.

""We greatly appreciate and feel honoured by the trust placed by Temasek Foundation and Bank DBS Indonesia in us to distribute basic needs and meal packages to garment workers who have lost their income due to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Confederation of All Indonesian Trade Union President Elly Rosita Silaban. On a similar note, Founder of Foodbank of Indonesia, Hendro Utomo, said, ""Temasek Foundation and Bank DBS Indonesia’s support has greatly assisted those who are now losing their jobs or who are currently less interested in their merchandise. Thank you for the trust that was given to FOI who is striving to open access to food for the lowest population so that they get basic rights to food and work well. That's the essence of the movement Mereka Butuh Kita that we voiced. This also serves as a model of neighborly collaboration between the Singaporean people represented by the Temasek Foundation, the private sector represented by Bank DBS Indonesia, and CSOs such as FOI for the Indonesian people, to jointly manage current and future social issues.” Bank DBS Indonesia also invites all customers to take part in making donations through Yayasan Benih Baik Indonesia.

DBS partners Food Bank to better address food gaps for the vulnerable through Singapore's first virtual food banking app,04 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_Food_Bank_to_better_address_food_gaps_for_the_vulnerable_through_Singapores_first_virtual_food_banking_app, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced a partnership with The Food Bank Singapore to enhance Singapore’s food donation ecosystem, and better address food gaps for the vulnerable by connecting corporate donors to food support organisations via the nation’s first virtual food banking app. This is timely as Covid-19 is expected to have a prolonged impact on the economy, which would inadvertently weigh on the income of many individuals and families, exacerbating food insecurity. According to Economist Intelligence Unit’s Global Food Security Index, Singapore is the most food secure country in 2018 and 2019. However, the 2019 UN report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World found that 4.1% of thepopulation in Singapore still faced moderate to severe food insecurity. This shows that addressing food insecurity is a continuous work in progress, particularly for the more vulnerable in society, and highlights a need for enhancements to Singapore’s current food support system to ensure food needs are better matched with the dietary needs of beneficiaries. Our Volunteers packing foodstuff at the warehouse and helping with the Fresh Food Truck project Currently, most of the food insecure such as the elderly and low-income families facing prolonged unemployment or health issues, receive support from the more than 100 food-support organisations locally. But a sizeable amount of the food tends to be allocated to beneficiaries residing in rental flats, which often results in food being left till past its shelf life and thrown away. On the other hand, some households which have large families and genuinely need help in putting the next meal on the table but stay in larger flats, or have higher per household income, tend to fall through the cracks and lack sufficient food support. These are issues the virtual food banking app aims to solve. With the virtual food banking app, greater coordination and targeting of food support will be made possible, as food support organisations can submit requests to donors in real-time and on-the-go. For instance, donors can share the type and quantity of food they have on hand via the app, enabling food support organisations to have real-time visibility of the items available. This also helps facilitate more relevant food matching and support, ensuring beneficiaries receive the right quantum and types of food they need, minimising food waste, which is one of the largest waste streams in Singapore [1] . Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee said, “Since late 2019, we have brought together government agencies, food charities and volunteers passionate about the food charity landscape, as part of a ‘food workgroup’ to forge partnerships, co-create solutions to reduce food wastage and address food insecurity issues faced by low-income and vulnerable families. I am heartened by this innovative collaboration championed by DBS Bank and Food Bank. This is a timely initiative, which could enhance the way we organise food aid and coordinate donations as we tide through Covid-19 together.” Said DBS Singapore Country Head Shee Tse Koon, “With many families facing a big dent to their income with the Covid-19 situation, we hope that this initiative will provide the impetus for the various participants in Singapore’s food donation ecosystem to come together as a united whole. With the virtual food banking app, we will have greater visibility of the support gaps in Singapore, and we hope more donors will be encouraged to come forth and make the commitment with us to help put food on the table for those in need.” Expected to be launched in 4Q2020, the virtual food banking app aims to streamline the food donation process by connecting donors, social service agencies, food support organisations, and logistics providers via a single platform. This removes the need for extra handling, reduces spoilage and ensures that fresh food reaches those in need more quickly. The virtual food banking app also aims to collect data for analysis to enable agencies to better understand needs on the ground. Going digital will also reduce some of the laborious and cumbersome paperwork involved. “The Food Bank Singapore has been brainstorming possible solutions for the past three years as we realise that there are gaps in feeding programmes across agencies. Without big data, it is tougher to address these gaps. It is crucial for The Food Bank Singapore to digitalise to increase our efficiency. Since we only have a lean team of seven full-time staff, the virtual food bank will gradually reduce our reliance on the need for data entry. The app will be a great starting point to test a circular ecosystem where donors, beneficiary organisations and logistics providers can be looped onto one platform to better facilitate food aid. Covid-19 has allowed us to create a catalyst for change as the needs on the ground will not be the same as before,” said The Food Bank Singapore co-founder Nichol Ng. DBS and The Food Bank Singapore are also working with TreeDots [2] , a social enterprise supported by the DBS Foundation, to leverage its network of food producers, importers, distributors, and F&B businesses to enhance the supply and predictability of food donations, and to amplify the impact of the virtual food banking platform. This is in addition to the bank’s ongoing efforts to engage its network of corporate clients to come onboard the platform as pilot donors. DBS is the founding partner for the virtual food banking platform and will be financing its development. Committed to creating a positive social impact In April, DBS launched its SGD 10.5 million DBS Stronger Together Fund to help communities hard hit by Covid-19 across the region. Through the fund, the bank will provide about 4.5 million meals and care packs to affected individuals across its six key markets, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. As part of the initiative, in Singapore, DBS is partnering The Food Bank Singapore and Itsrainingraincoats to distribute up to 700,000 meals to underserved segments, including the elderly, low-income and migrant workers, with the support of employees and fellow Singaporeans. These meals in turn will be procured from the bank’s SME clients from 23 F&B outlets, including Koufu Group, Chang Cheng Group, Wee Nam Kee and Gao Ji, providing much-needed support to the hard-hit sector amid these challenging times. DBS Foundation has also been active in providing financial and non-financial support to social enterprises, helping them to tide through this trying period. In this year’s DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant Programme, the bank introduced a new Zero Food Waste category, aimed at supporting social enterprises with innovative solutions which reduce food waste. With this programme, DBS is able to support businesses that do good for both the environment and society. [1]  https://www.towardszerowaste.sg/foodwaste/ [2] TreeDots aims to reduce food wastage through a platform linking businesses with unsold inventory to potential buyers, to prevent perfectly edible food from ending up in the bin. Leveraging machine learning and integrated systems, it enhances the efficiency of food distribution. The DBS Foundation Grant awarded to TreeDots in 2018 was used to enhance their online platform.

DBS Bank India’s custom API solution empowers TCIL’s truck drivers; ensures timely mobility and increases efficiency,02 Jun 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_Indias_custom_API_solution_empowers_TCILs_truck_drivers_ensures_timely_mobility_and_increases_efficiency, India ,"- DBS Bank India has introduced a completely digital and innovative payments solution in the Indian transportation and logistics sector. Taking forward DBS' commitment to support lives and livelihoods, the bank has partnered with TCIL for empowering truck drivers by facilitating real-time payments through the DBS RAPID (Real Time APIs by DBS) solution, thereby enabling them to receive payments instantly. Given the large volumes of transactions, and round-the-clock nature of the operations, the bank proposed setting up a UPI-based real-time payments solution which is available 24x7x365. The solution has been set up under the aegis of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). DBS RAPID (Real-time APIs by DBS) and UPI payments, provides a seamless integration with the company's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. With this solution, TCIL truck drivers receive an instant credit into their bank account, which they can then swipe at terminals or withdraw cash using ATMs. TCIL is among India's leading integrated supply chain and logistics solutions providers, with revenues over INR 3,200 Cr and an extensive pan-India network. Established in 1958, it has developed a vast bouquet of product offerings encompassing multimodal freight management, supply chain design-cum-implementation, and coastal movements, thus operates a large fleet to manage its business demands. This further increases the need to make advance payments to the truck drivers for expenses such as fuel requirements, payment at tolls and, other miscellaneous expenses. Earlier, these payments were primarily made by cash or prepaid cards resulting in physical engagements and unwarranted delays. Divyesh Dalal, Head - Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank India said, “At DBS, we anticipate customer needs and offer solutions that meet their end-to-end requirement. We follow a pre-emptive approach and create customized offerings to bring more convenience and value to our customers. DBS RAPID can be seamlessly integrated into our corporate customers' systems or platforms, to facilitate payments and banking transactions in real-time. In the case of TCIL, it enables truck drivers to live hassle-free and manage their expenses with ease, thereby aligning with our commitment to supporting lives and livelihoods. Ashish Tiwari, Group CFO, TCIL said, At TCIL, we have immense focus on customer-centric approach and State-of-Art technology. The DBS RAPID solution has strengthened internal controls, reduced our cost, and increased our pace of business. We are proud to have partnered with DBS Bank, which has enabled us to contribute to digital India in a meaningful way and drive India towards a digital economy.  Praveena Rai, COO, NPCI said, We, at NPCI, are happy to collaborate with DBS Bank for the UPI-based innovative digital solution - DBS RAPID. We believe, this initiative will empower truck drivers as they can now receive money real-time with UPI, to manage their day-to-day expenses. We aim to provide a convenient and safe UPI transaction experience to all sections of society. DBS Bank's real-time APIs-driven solution will enable seamless and contactless payments, which is the need-of-the-hour. This aligns with our overall mission, as we urge organisations to adopt robust digital solutions and manage transactions virtually. DBS RAPID has enabled TCIL to improve customer experiences through a reduced turn-around time and quicker mobilisation of goods. The dependence on cash has reduced significantly, and lower digital transaction costs have ensured higher acceptability of the solution among fleet operators. DBS RAPID has also been adopted by companies such as Mahanagar Gas, Lykos, Herbalife, and Zolo Stays. This solution was also recently recognized by Corporate Treasurer as one of the Best Treasury & Finance Strategies in Asia-Pacific.

Huge investment opportunities and eco-friendly financing in Indonesia | Bahasa,28 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Huge_investment_opportunities_and_eco_friendly_financing_in_Indonesia, Indonesia ,"- Nearly two years ago, in early July 2018, PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (SMI) issued an eco-friendly bond or green bond. SMI became the first bond issuer in Indonesia to issue a green bond. SMI planned to issue a total of Rp3 trillion worth of 'eco-friendly bond'. SMI allocated the proceeds from the sale of Sarana Multi Infrastruktur Sustainable Green Bond I to finance eco-friendly infrastructure projects, including renewable energy, eco-friendly transportation, as well as water treatment and management projects. SMI received assistance from the World Bank Group in preparing the framework for the eco-friendly bond. There are six eco-friendly projects to be financed using the proceeds from the bond issuance. Three projects are related to the financing of light rail transit (LRT) projects in Palembang and Greater Jakarta (Jabodetabek), and the financing of the rolling stock of LRT carriages produced by PT Inka. Three other projects are mini hydro power plants in North Sulawesi and West Sumatra and a water treatment and management project in Cilegon, Banten. The awareness of the importance of sustainable development, as stated in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has boosted the growth of eco-friendly investment. During the period 2010-2014, the amount of eco-friendly investment that was realized accounted for around 30.3 percent (Rp486 trillion) of the total investment value (Rp1,600 trillion), according to data from the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). Of the total, US$26.8 billion was foreign direct investment (FDI) and Rp139.1 trillion was domestic investment (PMDN). To boost eco-friendly investment, the government offers fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, such as tax exemptions as stipulated in Finance Ministerial Regulation No.159 of 2015, and tax cuts regulated by Government Regulation No.9 of 2016. The Indonesian government pledged its commitment at the Conference of Parties (COP) 15 in 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark, to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 26 percent (by own effort) and by 41 percent (with international assistance) by 2020. The Indonesian government’s commitment was strengthened through the first Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) document in November 2016 after the stipulation of an unconditional target (by own effort) of 29 percent and a conditional target (with international assistance) of up to 41 percent compared to the business as usual scenario in 2030. The transition to low GHG emissions development requires massive amounts of investment and financial support. International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank Group, estimated that Indonesia needs an investment of US$274 billion or close to Rp3,870 trillion until 2030. It is clearly impossible for the government alone to provide the huge amount of financial support and investment. The participation of many parties, including financial institutions, is needed to finance the transition to sustainable development. According to the Green Finance Opportunities in ASEAN report published by DBS Bank,the estimated amount of financing for eco-friendly investment in ASEAN countries from 2016 to 2030 is US$3 trillion. The funds are absorbed by the infrastructure sector (US$1.8 trillion), renewable energy (US$400 billion), energy efficiency (US$400 billion), and food crops (US$400 billion). Indonesia will absorb the largest portion (36 percent) of the financing. At the end of 2014, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) developed a Sustainable Finance Roadmap ( Peta Jalan Keuangan Berkelanjutan ). The Roadmap defines Sustainable Finance as the overall support from the financial services industry for sustainable growth as a result of harmony (or balance) between economic, social and environmental interests.

DBS drives more industry-first bonds with Asia's inaugural green bond issuance by a university,27 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_drives_more_industry_first_bonds_with_Asias_inaugural_green_bond_issuance_by_a_university, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank announced today that it is the sole lead manager and bookrunner in Asia’s first green bond issuance by a university. The National University of Singapore’s (NUS) SGD300 million 10-year green bond with a coupon rate of 1.565% also marks Singapore’s first by a public institution, paving the way for more tertiary institutions from the region to tap debt capital markets for their funding needs. The deal was done by way of private placement, fully underwritten by DBS. Clifford Lee, Global Head of Fixed Income, DBS Bank, said, “Education is viewed globally as a sector that is resilient to economic cycles. We hope that this bond will be the first of many to come, and will heighten the focus on sustainability concerns, especially amidst this period of pandemic-related societal and market stress.” The bond proceeds will go towards financing green projects by the university. The green bond is expected to be rated Aaa by Moody’s. DBS’ efforts to develop Asia’s sustainability-linked bonds market  DBS has been steadily supporting its corporate clients to mobilise capital market financing via the issuance of green bonds. In 2019, the bank underwrote over SGD 4 billion worth of green bonds, with the raised proceeds used to finance a number of projects in renewable energy, clean transportation, energy efficiency, and water and wastewater management sectors across the region. DBS also issued its own green bond back in 2017, which marked the first international green bond issuance out of South-east Asia. The launch of the green bond is in line with the bank’s commitment to sustainability and efforts to adopt a triple bottom line approach in its business activities, focusing on social and environmental goals along with financial objectives. The bank has since gone on to structure and underwrite other sustainability-linked deals, such as social bonds which have come into the spotlight amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Social bonds have seen a major upswing in recent months. With the pandemic hitting many communities hard, we see a surge in demand for credit that helps fund causes that make positive social impact. Everyone from institutional investors to central banks is looking for ways to help alleviate the impact faced by the communities they operate in, and we expect to see more of such structures in the year to come,” said Lee. DBS was joint lead manager for a EUR 500 million issuance for Korea Housing Finance Corporation in 2018. This was Asia’s first social covered bond at the time. The bank has also partnered other parties on the world's first listed social bond, a USD 8 million Women's Livelihood Bond in 2017, as well as its second issuance of USD 12 million in Women’s Livelihood Bond 2 earlier this year.

Bank DBS Indonesia and Manulife Indonesia launch a financial solution that sustains customers’ lifestyle in the future | Bahasa,27 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Bank_DBS_Indonesia_and_Manulife_Indonesia_launch_a_financial_solution_that_sustains_customers_lifestyle_in_the_future, Indonesia ,"- Bank DBS Indonesia and Manulife Indonesia joined hands to address customers’ needs and help realize their financial goals through a newly launched financial solution MiTreasure Flexi Assurance (MiFA) amid the currently challenging global landscape. Through this product, Manulife and Bank DBS Indonesia offers investment and long-term protection that customers need. “MiFA launch is a testament to the commitment of Bank DBS Indonesia to ceaselessly provide services and address customers’ needs, especially our priority customers who have trusted us to carry out their asset management. We are confident that this partnership with Manulife will elevate our customers’ comfort and peace of mind as they work toward their financial goals,” said President Director of Bank DBS Indonesia Paulus Sutisna. Ryan Charland, President Director and CEO Manulife Indonesia added that, “We understand that customers need protection solutions that are more diverse. MiFa is a comprehensive solution that allows customers to optimize fund growth through investment, meet their long-term needs, and on top of that protect Indonesian families. This is the financial solution for those who know the importance of financial planning, of anticipating market movement, and of protecting themselves and their families from the multitude of risks in the future.” As customers need to sustain their current lifestyle in the future and upon entering their golden period, it is likely that there will be challenges that shift or even lessen the value of their financial assets. The reason may be market volatility or global financial dynamics, which could prompt customers to trim their lifestyle to ensure that their essential needs are covered. Unfortunately, more often than not, those challenges are not met with a reliable financial plan. According to Manulife Investment Sentiment Index (MISI) XI, investors allocate less than 20% of their savings for their golden period and only 10% of investors that rely on insurance to prepare for retirement or their golden days later in life. While insurance is an option for them to bolster their financial condition after they are no longer productive, the number of investors who have made insurance as their financial choice remains low. Considering the low needs for insurance as the financial instrument for non-productive days, MiFA is launched as the solution. This product is designed to protect a customer’s financial assets and can be continued by the next generations. MiTreasure Flexi Assurance is a life insurance product with extensive benefits and provides lifelong protection until 110 years of age, complemented with investment feature and a wide variety of riders (additional insurance) to complement customer’s need. Its long-term protection affords the customers enough room to be well-prepared for their future and to prepare the financial legacy for the next generations, sustaining the same lifestyle as the customers’ productive years. In addition, this product allocates 50% of funds for investment during the first year and 100% investment from the second to the tenth year, and 102% investment starting from the eleventh year of policy. Customer will receive loyalty benefits up to 200% of the annual basic premium at the end of the fifth-year policy according to the terms and conditions of the product. At the end of a contract, customer will receive the accumulated policy value that they can utilize as their financial asset. Bank DBS Indonesia and Manulife has been partnering in 2016 and together have launched various products from unit link, life insurance, to health insurance. MiTreasure Flexi Assurance will be available through the bancassurance channel of Bank DBS Indonesia.  [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

"DBS provides liquidity support to over 3,500 micro and small enterprises, entrenching support for oft-underserved segment",25 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_provides_liquidity_support_to_over_3500_micro_and_small_enterprises_entrenching_support_for_oft_underserved_segment, Singapore ,"- Reinforcing its support for micro [1] and small [2] enterprise customers, usually the most underserved and vulnerable of businesses, during this challenging Covid-19 period, DBS has approved over 3,500 loans totalling over SGD 1.1 billion for them under Enterprise Singapore’s financing schemes [3] . This accounts for eight in ten of all Government-assisted SME loans that the bank has approved between the start of March 2020 and mid-May 2020. Of the more than 3,500 loans approved for micro and small enterprises, around three in ten loans were for customers with no prior relationship with the bank, while over half were for customers with no prior borrowing history with DBS. Among those with no borrowing history with DBS, the average loan quantum was SGD 250,000, with two out of three borrowing SGD 200,000 and below, of which over 800 borrowed SGD 100,000 and below. Borrowers came mainly from the services [4] (27 per cent), building and construction (13 per cent), general wholesale (12 per cent), food and beverages (11 per cent), and retail (9 per cent) sectors. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking at DBS, noted that micro and small enterprises may not be familiar with the financing solutions available to meet their working capital needs, as they have typically flown under the radar of lenders. “While we are committed to supporting all viable SMEs through these difficult times, we are doubling down on our support for micro and small enterprises. Many have sound business models but are facing a cash crunch with business momentum slowing significantly due to the extended safe distancing and circuit breaker measures. Meantime, overheads and contractual expenses still have to be met. We are engaging our micro and small businesses closely to ensure that they have the working capital support they need to meet these challenges.” The Federation of Merchants' Associations, Singapore (FMAS) is one key stakeholder that DBS is working with to ensure that working capital support reaches the most challenged micro and small businesses. DBS and FMAS have been collaborating on solutions to ease the cash flow challenges faced by heartland enterprises since early April. There are over 15,000 heartland enterprises across 14 town centres in Singapore, spanning a diverse range of businesses, from kopitiam owners to service providers and neighbourhood mom and pop shops. Yeo Hiang Meng, President of the FMAS, said, “When our stakeholders came to us for help amidst the mighty economic storm, DBS was our most natural port of call. DBS was the first bank in Singapore to work with us on availing Government-assisted SME loans to our heartland businesses, and many of our SMEs have benefitted from their timely support. In fact, DBS has a long history of supporting our heartland enterprises even before Covid-19 situation began unfolding, and we’re thankful that they have chosen to stand resolutely with us during these difficult times.” Tee added that heartland businesses are an integral part of Singapore’s community as they bring vibrancy to the heartlands and provide a variety of goods and services to Singaporeans from all walks of life. “It would be a shame for promising businesses to fold as a result of conditions they have no control over. We are fighting not only for the survival of these businesses, but for the very spirit of entrepreneurship that forms the bedrock of Singapore’s economy.” DBS has kept its lending rates low for its SME Working Capital Loan and the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme by tapping the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s SGD Facility for Enterprise Singapore Loans. In doing so, DBS accesses low-cost funding and passes on all cost savings to its SME customers. The bank has also gone one step further by being the first in the industry to waive all processing fees since February, thus removing another cost component. As a result, DBS is able to extend loans from the Enterprise Singapore financing schemes at interest rates averaging 2 to 3 per cent, which are among historic lows for the industry. Providing SMEs with fast access to working capital in five working days DBS is committed to ensuring that all viable businesses with liquidity challenges receive working capital financing support in a timely manner. Customers with complete loan applications and full documentation submitted together with their loan application forms can expect to receive working capital monies within five working days of acceptance. Since March 2020, DBS has seen a surge in the number SME loan applications, and in SMEs’ rush to get access to liquidity, the bank has also seen a surge in incomplete loan applications with little or incorrect supporting documentation. Customers who wish to access working capital fast should: Ensure that their loan application forms and supporting documentation are complete at the point of submission Ensure that information provided in the forms and documents are accurate and in accordance with the relevant time period requested on the application form Get back to the bank in a timely manner when asked for any missing documents during the loan approval process DBS has also specially tailored its Digital Business Loan to the needs of micro and small businesses, disbursing up to SGD 200,000 in working capital as quickly as the day after approval. To relieve micro and small enterprises of the onerous task of producing audited financial statements, DBS has further simplified the credit documentation process for this loan with no financials required for applications. Instead, customers need only provide their most recent bank statement or Notice of Assessment for their application to be processed. Keeping SME customers safe with contact-free, digital loan application and acceptance In an industry first, physical loan application and acceptance procedures, such as filling up physical forms and obtaining wet signatures, have been replaced with remote and digital procedures. With the loan application and acceptance process digitised and made contact-free, customers are now able to receive the financing support they need from the safety of their home offices. Since March 2020, about six in 10 of all SME loan applications have been made through digital channels. The bank has also rolled out complimentary webinars and online courses to further ease SMEs into the world of digital banking. To date, over 1,000 clients have been trained on how they can transact, trade and manage their banking needs from the comfort of their home offices. DBS is also equipping all SMEs with a complimentary Covid-19 SME Business Resource Guide to give business owners the insights needed to navigate their businesses through the current economic uncertainty. The guide contains fresh perspectives from industry leaders on how the operating landscape is likely to change as a result of Covid-19, and actionable tips for SMEs to position themselves for recovery and growth as economies in the region look towards a gradual restart. The guide can be downloaded at dbs.com.sg/sme/dbs-forms/businessclass/covid-19-guide [1] DBS defines companies with annual revenue of less than SGD 1 million as ‘micro SMEs’.

"27,000 students to benefit from DBS-ITE financial literacy programme via home-based learning (HBL) amid Covid-19",20 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/27000_students_to_benefit_from_DBS_ITE_financial_literacy_programme_via_home_based_learning_HBL_amid_Covid_19, Singapore ,"- The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and DBS Bank are rolling out an enhanced ITE-wide financial literacy programme to all 27,000 of ITE’s attending students. With ITE rolling out Home-Based Learning (HBL) given elevated Covid-19 social-distancing measures, lessons have been adapted accordingly for students. This year’s iteration expands on last year’s pilot, which involved 10,000 Year 1 students 1 . The new curriculum for Year 2 students will focus on teaching them how to manage their finances after they graduate and enter the workforce. The DBS-ITE financial literacy programme complements the government’s current MoneySense financial education curriculum, with each lesson structured to help students relate easily to bite-sized information. This approach, optimised with the use of intuitive digital learning tools, will enhance lesson delivery for HBL. As part of the curriculum refresh, more time has been allocated to hands-on activities this year so students can more easily apply the personalised insights gleaned to their daily lives. Said Li Xinling, Lecturer at ITE College West, “In challenging times like these, it has become more critical for students to be equipped with the right knowledge and tools to make prudent financial decisions. This is especially since more monetary transactions are being conducted digitally. We have continued to support our students’ financial learning in this period, by adapting the lessons for delivery as web-based exercises.” Year 2 students will be taught subjects such as how Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts work; learn about the different types of insurance coverage available; and acquire best practices on cybersecurity. They will also be introduced to the basics of investing and how to protect their assets against inflation. Year 1 students can make use of DBS’ new digital advisory solution, NAV Planner, as a complementary digital learning tool which provides them a personalised balance sheet as well as insights, analyses and suggestions unique to them. Students shown to have made good progress on their financial wellness journeys Last year’s pilot was designed so programme administrators were able to measure any changes in the students’ financial habits with DBS’ data analytics capabilities. These findings, synthesised with a qualitative survey of the pilot student batch, revealed the following insights: • A vast majority (more than 95%) of the 2,500 respondents say they now have a better understanding of their spending habits and are committed to saving more of their allowance. The dollar amount of students’ savings had also increased by 80%, suggesting that they were able to incorporate what they learnt in class easily into their daily habits. • More than 60% now receive their pocket money electronically. This is a reversal from previous behaviour the administrators observed1, which can be directly attributed to the ease and convenience the students experienced with digital payments and digital financial planning capabilities. Debit cards, NETS and DBS PayLah! are the top three digital payment methods they prefer. • The majority also found an earlier iteration of NAV Planner 2 useful as a pocket digital financial planner, with many highlighting they found the budgeting capability extremely useful. One in three students now uses a digital financial planning app regularly as compared to their peers, where one in four does so. • Parents and friends are the two top-ranked sources of influence on how students spend their money; almost half credit their parents, which underscores the importance of parents teaching their children about money from when they are young. Said Syamira Bte Mohammad Sidi, a student from ITE College West who is part of the pilot, “In the past, I would often buy a lot of clothes on impulse but I did not wear a lot of these clothes. After going through this course, I pay attention to every dollar I spend and what I spend it on. I will think twice before buying something and only buy what I need. This has allowed me to save more money. I have learnt that savings are important to help me achieve my future goals. Through savings, I can fund my plan for further studies and reduce my parents’ financial load.” “Hearing such positive feedback is incredibly encouraging and we, together with our partners at ITE, will continue to help students to take charge of their personal finances,” said Jeremy Soo, DBS’ Singapore Head of Consumer Banking Group. “DBS’ proprietary financial planning framework comprehensively covers our customers for every life stage and by extending this approach to the new Year 2 curriculum, we hope we can help ease the students’ transition into their next phase in life more seamlessly. This year is also a learning opportunity for these young adults as it has brought home the importance of having good financial habits, and how these habits can help safeguard one’s finances in times of crisis.” Ms Low Khah Gek, CEO, ITE added: “Cultivating good personal financial habits is an important life skill. By drawing insights of youths' financial habits through data analytics, the DBS-ITE financial literacy curriculum has incorporated practical examples that students can relate to. Students can also turn knowledge into action, by using digital tools to track and manage their expenses. We are glad that many of them have improved their spending and saving habits through the curriculum, and taken their first step towards financial wellness.” Classes developed under the DBS-ITE financial literacy programme are offered as enhanced segments within mandatory modules under ITE’s Lifeskills curriculum. DBS is committed to its plan to reach every Singaporean, regardless of their income levels, to help them get started on their financial wellness journeys. In doing so, the bank has conducted free financial literacy classes and partnered with various government and tertiary institutions, such as ITE, to help educate the public on a wide range of topics.

DBS spreads instant cheer to merchants on Ramadan E-Bazaar platform,18 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_spreads_instant_cheer_to_merchants_on_Ramadan_E_Bazaar_platform, Singapore ,"- With Ramadan in full swing, and the bazaars that go with the season having to make the leap to go digital in just days, DBS today announced that it is helping more than 800 merchants on e-Bazaar platform, BazaarRia, to get paid instantly. To prepare for Hari Raya Puasa, which marks the end of Ramadan, bazaars sell everything from home decorations and clothing to sweet treats and electronics. However, due to extended circuit breaker measures, all physical Ramadan bazaars have been cancelled, leaving many merchants with a sudden and unexpected loss in income and cashflow. Many of these merchants, which often transact in cash, also tend to depend on Ramadan bazaars across various townships in Singapore to make up a good percentage of their annual revenue. To address the income and cashflow gap arising from the cancellation of physical bazaars, e-bazaar platforms have been stepping up to help bring merchants online. However, most e-bazaar payment methods tend to accept only credit card payments – making it inaccessible to the one in four Singaporeans who do not have one [1] , and also limiting the clientele that merchants can reach out to. BazaarRia stands out from the crowd as its payment systems are integrated with DBS MAX, which is DBS’ mobile-based QR payment collection solution enabling businesses to receive funds instantly. Because of that, credit cards are not required for payment and customers can pay through an instant bank transfer made through his or her mobile phone. All a customer needs to do after finalising the basket of items to be purchased, is to use his/her mobile phone to scan the automatically generated PayNow QR code on the BazaarRia payment page, and the funds will be instantly sent to the merchant, completing the sale in just a few seconds. In turn, merchants enjoy real-time collection of payments which will be automatically consolidated into their bank accounts. Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore CEO, said, “As a country that is rich in culture and heritage, Ramadan and the lead-up to Hari Raya Puasa is an important part of our social calendar. We hope that by empowering merchants to transact digitally in double quick time, we can spark joy by bringing the spirit of the season back to the homes of Singaporeans and sustain the livelihoods of small businesses. We see ourselves as having an integral role to play in helping businesses tide through this crisis, emerging stronger together.” DBS Bank worked with its client, Mi Planets Pte Ltd (Mi Planets), which is the platform developer for BazaarRia, to integrate the bank’s digital payments and collections solution, DBS MAX, into the e-Bazaar platform. Abu Bakar Mohd Nor, Chairman and CEO of Mi Planets, said, “Many businesses have been disrupted this Ramadan period, and we wanted to find a way to help to keep the festivities going by helping businesses go online. We needed a bank partner to help us implement a reliable payment gateway and we decided to work with DBS due to its leadership in digital payment platforms and extensive banking network in Singapore. We’re glad that with the support of the bank, we managed to integrate DBS MAX into BazaarRia in just one month, despite the challenges faced during this extended circuit breaker period. We look forward to continuing this partnership with DBS as we grow our business.” Normah Abas, owner of floral decor business, ZN Exclusive Creation, said that this year has been the most challenging Ramadan and Hari Raya season she has experienced since she set up shop five years ago. “With the circuit breaker measures, our sales went down to zero for a period of time as we were stuck with the closure of all physical Ramadan bazaars in Singapore. We’re grateful for the support from DBS and Mi Planet in helping us bring our business online onto BazaarRia in just one week, without which, we would have been left stranded with heavy losses from an oversupply of inventory.” Helping businesses to fast-track their transition towards digital payments Helping SME customers bank, trade and transact digitally is a priority for DBS during the circuit breaker period, with more SMEs looking to go digital to create new income streams. DBS has been working closely with its SME clients since 2018 to educate and encourage these businesses to transition to digital payment adoption. This has led to a healthy pick-up in adoption rates for DBS digital payment solutions, such as DBS MAX, which has seen transaction volumes increase more than six-fold in the first quarter of the year, compared with the same period a year ago. DBS has also seen healthy traction in PayNow Corporate registrations, with 44% market share of Singapore’s PayNow Corporate registrations and more than half of the industry’s market share in terms of transaction and trade volumes. The bank has also rolled out complimentary webinars and online courses to further ease customers into the world of digital banking. To date, over 800 clients have been trained on how they can transact, trade and manage their banking needs from the comfort of their home offices.

Bank DBS Indonesia collaborates with Blibli.com to hold online discussion for business players | Bahasa,18 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Bank_DBS_Indonesia_collaborates_with_Blibli_com_to_hold_online_discussion_for_business_players, Indonesia ,"- As one of the biggest contributors to Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP), small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a part in determining Indonesia's economic condition, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In view of the fact, Bank DBS Indonesia as a banking institution with leading business and industry insights, collaborated with BliBli.com to hold a talk show taking ""What Business Can Do and Adapting with this New Normal"" as its theme to provide insights for BliBli.com partner merchants and other businesses. The talk show demonstrated Bank DBS Indonesia's commitment to advancing Indonesia’s SME industry. Dewi Meisari, founder of ukmindonesia.id, explained about the huge opportunity and policy support for SMEs amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Maynard Priajaya Arif, VP Group Research at DBS Bank, gave a presentation on the economic outlook during the Covid-19 pandemic and a post-Covid-19 economic projection. The results of a rapid survey conducted by ukmindonesia.id on more than its 230 members in March 2020 revealed that more than 70% of SMEs felt the impact of a drastic drop in business turnover, with some even experiencing a negative impact. Meanwhile, sales of herbal products, fruit, frozen food - all via online transactions - have increased. ""In today’s digital era, online marketing skills are a key to running a successful business. According to  2019 data from the Ministry of Communication and Information, around 20% of SMEs market their products online,"" Dewi said. Dewi also explained several strategies for businesses to be able to compete in the market. First is cost cutting: discuss with employees a temporary salary cut, compensated with less workload (including through reduced work hours); second is gaining access to government programs that can help reduce costs (e.g. loan installments, electricity, BPJS, taxes, and others); third, seeking other feasible opportunities - temporary shifting - as long as it can bring in income (for example, a coffee shop can shift into fruit or frozen food or red ginger business); second, proactively explore information (browsing, joining community, etc.); fourth, spend as much time as possible to learn and improve your business (for example, improve your logo, learn to better market your products online, look for marketing opportunities through e-commerce, take part in various online training programs, and improve your finances). Economic Outlook In her economic outlook, Maynard said Covid-19 will have a broad impact on global economic growth. A look at ASEAN economies as a whole in 2020 shows that economic growth will slow, with some countries to experience negative growth. Considering the positive side of Indonesia's growth data compared to ASEAN, Indonesia’s growth tends to be more resilient. Based on the forecast of DBS Research Group, Indonesia's growth currently stands at around 1-1.3%. Although it is slightly below the government's assumption, at least the growth is still positive. The impacts of the crises that occured after the 1998 crisis were local in nature. The 2001 Dot.com crisis in the US, for example, and the 2008 financial crisis that caused several banks to collapse, only affected developed countries but did not have a significant impact on Indonesia as its economy continued to run well. However, Covid-19 is different. It has spread globally and the mortality rate is quite high, making the impact greater than past crises. In addition, government efforts in various countries to contain the spread of Covid-19 through various policies have a major impact on the economy and other sectors, including the transportation and tourism sectors. The question is, how long will this last? The first case in Indonesia was announced in early March and the number is still increasing. The question is, will the peak occur in the second quarter or will it continue in the third quarter? Based on current assumptions, the peak is expected in the second quarter, with improvements after June. China and South Korea have the best Covid-19 curves, with the number of cases declining and almost no new cases reported. China’s economy is also slowly picking up pace. Learning from China’s experience, it can take up to four months to arrive at this phase. It is hoped that Indonesia will be able to enter the recovery phase in July and control the spread of the virus and to see improvements. Maynard also said that in terms of macroeconomy, the impact of Covid-19 in Indonesia started to be felt in the first quarter. According to data announced by the government, in the first quarter, our GDP growth fell by only around 2.97%, the slowest growth in the last five years, even in the last ten years after the 2010 global crisis. What must be considered when looking at the characteristics of Indonesia’s economy is the consumption sector, which is the largest contributor (about half of GDP). To prevent deeper negative impacts, the government is seeking to maintain the stability of the consumption sector by providing stimulus. Indonesia Outlook - DBS Forecast Given the current GDP growth, if in the third quarter (July) - on the assumption that the Large-scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) are lifted and there is no second wave of the pandemic - then economic growth can resume. However, Maynard added, Indonesia must prepare for the worst scenario, as stated by the Minister of Finance. In a worst-case scenario, GDP growth could hit -0.4% and the rupiah exchange rate could plunge to Rp20,000 per US dollar. There are two factors that can cause this to happen. The first is the second wave of the pandemic in the second semester and the second is the policies of the governments and central banks that cannot be implemented comprehensively. To read the research conducted by the DBS Bank Regional Research Group team, please visit https://www.dbs.id/id/treasures/aics/home.page Post-Covid-19 There are three things that must be considered from the consumer side. The first is, after the pandemic the economic condition will remain weak and consumers will continue to focus on maintaining cash flow and spending. As a result, they will look for cheaper goods. The second is how consumers will be more selective and business people must be prepared for changes in consumer behavior. The third is, consumers will prefer local products. This will be a great opportunity for Indonesia’s SMEs. All businesses will try to market their products online, and competition will be tighter because after Covid-19 online shopping trends will increase. Be ready with a business strategy to retain customers with a variety of programs. Continue to prepare offline retail products. In the future, online and offline channels can be developed together because some products are still important offline. Therefore, prepare strategies that have a positive impact on both.

"DBS to hire over 2,000 people in Singapore this year, committed to creating and protecting jobs",14 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_hire_over_2000_people_in_Singapore_this_year_committed_to_creating_and_protecting_jobs_amid_pandemic, Singapore ,"- Recognising the key role it plays in society, DBS today announced that notwithstanding the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it is committed to hiring over 2,000 people in Singapore this year. Of this, more than 1,000 are new roles comprising a mix of traineeships for fresh graduates as well as more specialised roles for seasoned professionals. DBS’ annual internship programmes also continue unabated. The announcement follows an earlier pledge by the bank that it will protect the livelihoods of its 12,000-strong workforce in Singapore. The bank has reassured staff that there will be no layoffs. All employees, including branch staff who are unable to perform their duties because of temporary branch closures amid Circuit Breaker restrictions, continue to remain on full pay. In addition, employees facing a lull in work activity are encouraged to take the opportunity to upskill themselves through a comprehensive e-learning programme that DBS has in place. Piyush Gupta, CEO, DBS said, ""Covid-19 has been devastating not only to global health, but also to economies and jobs. Job seekers, including fresh graduates this year, are understandably anxious about the dearth of opportunities available as companies tighten their belts. While DBS is also prudent in our outlook, as a key employer in Singapore, it seemed right to us to not just continue with hiring for business-as-usual activities but also to actively create new jobs where we can, so as to help more people tide through this difficult period. In particular, we want to do our part to avoid having a 'lost' generation of young graduates in Singapore whose career prospects are jeopardised because they are unable to find jobs due to the pandemic."" In line with DBS' ongoing digitalisation efforts, among the new roles being created, more than one-third or over 360 jobs are for seasoned professionals in growth technology areas. They comprise more than 300 new jobs in the areas of UX/UI, data science, fraud detection compliance, as well as consumer and institutional banking technology. Additionally, DBS is looking to train and hire over 60 people in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, full stack development and data analytics through a range of specialised talent development programmes, namely the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme (TFIP) and the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) Mid-Career Advance, respectively. Both programmes aim to help seasoned professionals kickstart a technology career in financial services, with the TeSA Mid-Career Advance going a step further by reskilling those without a prior background in technology. In addition, DBS is also recruiting more than 700 young talent in the following areas: Specialised programmes, which include the bank’s Graduate Associate programmes, which are designed to groom fresh graduates into future banking leaders; the Applied Wealth Management Track, which is open to students enrolled in Nanyang Business School’s Bachelor of Business programme; DBS’ Analytics Capability Enhancement Programme and Executive Management Associate Programme, which both cater to promising postgraduates. The more tech-inclined can enrol to join the Skill Enhancement Education and Development (SEED) programme supported by TeSA, which trains those with less than two years of experience so they can ultimately grow careers in roles such as development, DevOps and cybersecurity. In all, DBS expects to hire 200 people into these programmes. Six to 12-month traineeships, with the possibility of conversion to a permanent role. As one of the pioneer host companies participating in the SGUnited Traineeships Programme, DBS will be also be offering 500 traineeships to recent and upcoming graduates from universities, polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education and other private educational institutions. These traineeships allow young graduates to develop their skills professionally and gain valuable working experience, giving them a firmer foothold in the job market when the economy recovers. Jaslyn Lee interned with DBS in 2019 as an undergraduate with the Nanyang Technological University’s Nanyang Business School, and was impressed with the bank’s work culture and commitment to driving sustainability. Wanting to launch her career with DBS, Jaslyn successfully applied for the bank’s Graduate Associate Programme, and will be joining DBS as a Graduate Associate later in the year after her graduation. “My peers and friends are all concerned about the current economic and hiring climate, so I’m thankful for the opportunity to build my career with DBS through their Graduate Associate Programme. I feel even more fortunate as DBS is a company I admire. I enjoyed my internship with DBS and was really inspired by the collaborative work environment and what the bank is doing on the sustainability front.” Dawn Lum is currently a trainee in Full Stack Development at DBS. After 14 years as a systems analyst in the telecommunications industry, Dawn wanted to carve a career in new technology areas. The TFIP provided her with such an opportunity. ""I've always been excited by how vibrant the technology scene in the banking and finance sector is, and wanted to be part of that story. I’m especially delighted to be able to upskill with DBS, with its strong digital DNA and community of technology experts. This gives me a credible foundation for launching a career as a technologist in the banking and finance sector, and I look forward to being able to continue contributing to DBS' digital transformation journey."" DBS will also continue to run its internship programmes as part of its commitment to nurturing future generations of banking talent, ensuring that students have the opportunity to put their academic skills to the test in a real-world work environment. DBS expects to offer over 400 internship opportunities in 2020. Finally, the Bank will continue to hire judiciously for other roles across the bank. It expects to make around 1,000 such hires in Singapore this year. Since the Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore in February, DBS has already made close to 500 hires to fill roles in client advisory, data, digital, technology as well as risk and control.

Baosteel and Rio Tinto complete first deal on Contour platform,12 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Baosteel_and_Rio_Tinto_complete_first_deal_on_Contour_platform, Singapore ,"- Contour , the open trade finance network, has today announced the completion of a Baosteel and Rio Tinto deal, supported by Chinsay , DBS Bank , essDOCS and Standard Chartered Bank , marking the first fully integrated paperless trade for Rio Tinto with a Chinese counterpart. As the first paperless deal in the iron ore industry to be transacted in Chinese Renminbi (RMB), the trade signifies an important step within the market for supporting the RMB currency. The collaboration between Rio Tinto and Baosteel also showcases how digital initiatives can effectively enhance the efficiency and security of cross-border trade finance flow, at a time when delivery of physical documentation can be more challenging. The paperless trade was possible thanks to Contour’s partnership with Chinsay – announced in March – and Chinsay’s ICP platform, which provides the corporate workflow and data for the process, allowing companies to easily collaborate in one place. The Letter of Credit (LC) issuance and approval of key contract terms was performed digitally and completely paperless, enabled by Chinsay and its ICP software. essDOCS, another Contour partner, managed the electronic bill of lading and other documentation through their CargoDocs service. Rio Tinto, Baosteel, ship agent, shipowner, DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank collaborated to draft, approve, sign, issue, transfer and electronically present the eB/L plus upload supporting documents. This resulted in significantly reducing trade document turnaround times and accelerating the trade via integrated data flow enabled by the CargoDocs-Countour interface. This application is vital in a new era where physical documents could be a major barrier to completing a trade. The transaction also marks DBS Bank’s first on Contour as the latest member to join the network. A leading financial services group in Asia, DBS was the advising and nominated bank for the deal, together with Standard Chartered Bank, a founding bank of Contour, as the issuing bank. Carl Wegner, CEO of Contour said: “To have another transaction take place on Contour’s network by two well-renowned names highlights the relevance this technology has for the sector. Now, more than ever, there is a greater demand for seamless, digital sign-off for the LC process. The delays and archaic processes that have marred the trade finance sector can no longer happen, and effective solutions are vital to keeping the sector alive. This transaction, combined with another well-respected financial institution joining our network and our ongoing relationship with Chinsay and essDOCS, furthers Contour’s aim of providing a neutral network where LC transactions can be conducted from start to finish.” John Laurens, Group Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank, said: “Sustaining and developing supply chains has never been more essential than it is right now. As businesses accelerate their digitalisation objectives to find new opportunities and counter challenges in the current trade environment, a collective effort across banks, industries and technology providers is key to driving digitalisation in a manner that delivers the network effect that is vital to trade. Digitalisation of trade presents an opportunity to not only transform the long term relationships with our clients, but also provide the necessary means to bring about sustainable and transformational changes to businesses, large and small, and across the ecosystems they are part of. As the latest member to join the Contour network, we are proud to have played an integral role in this landmark transaction by facilitating the first cross-border RMB-denominated trade settlement done digitally, where DBS took the lead as Rio Tinto’s nominated and advising bank to effectively manage forex risks pertaining to the transaction.” Simon Farry, Vice President, Sales & Marketing for Rio Tinto’s Iron Ore business: “The successful conclusion of this transaction with Baosteel demonstrates Rio Tinto’s commitment to collaborate with our customers and drive yet another first in the iron ore industry – paperless RMB trade. We will continue to utilise technology such as blockchain and end-to-end paperless solutions to enhance our customers’ experience and bring the industry closer to a full cross-border digital trade future.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS Bank is first Singapore bank to join Contour's Beta Network,11 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_is_first_Singapore_bank_to_join_Contours_Beta_Network, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank is the first Singapore bank to join Contour’s network, growing the number of banks on the platform driving a collective effort to digitalise global trade. Built on R3’s Corda, Contour’s network focuses on digitalising processes, including the creation, exchange, approval and issuance of letter of credits (LCs), which are often tedious and time-consuming. Joining Contour’s growing ecosystem of banks and partners aligns with DBS’ ongoing efforts to drive greater efficiencies in trade and unlock strategic value for its corporate customers. The demand for ‘contact-free’ banking amid the Covid-19 situation also makes digitalising trade processes an increasingly relevant and heightened priority for all participants during this period. Through Contour, DBS will be able to tap on the network’s digital solutions to provide a fully digital end-to-end LC settlement process for its customers – including the transfer of electronic trade and title documents. This helps shorten settlement time, reduce paperwork and simplify complex trade processes. Corporate customers can also conduct digital pre-issuance negotiation between applicant and beneficiary in real-time, and share this with DBS post-endorsement for LC Issuance. This increases the accuracy of LCs issued and helps facilitate quicker resolution in the event of discrepancies. In addition, customers will also enjoy enhanced transparency with real-time tracking of transactions on the platform, along with a full audit trail. Carl Wegner, CEO, Contour said: “Our network continues to grow. With more financial institutions joining the Beta Network, we are able to showcase the full potential that a blockchain solution can offer to trade finance. Efficiency in the LC issuance process is a vital part of upgrading the industry. Through our network, we can enable banks and corporates to leverage the shared transparency in the platform and manage information digitally which is even more important than ever for the trade finance industry.” John Laurens, Group Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS Bank, said: “We’ve been employing technology and digital solutions to innovatively unlock opportunities for our corporate customers across sectors and of all scale. This is more than simply digitising an historically paper-based service; it’s about transforming the way industries work by providing greater transparency, security and speed to build sustainable trade ecosystems that are able to weather the peaks and troughs of economic cycles and are resilient in times of crisis.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

"DBS primes Singapore’s logistics sector for post-Covid-19 recovery, pushes digital transformation forward with launch of industry’s first purchasing card",07 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_primes_Singapores_logistics_sector_for_post_Covid_19_recovery_pushes_digital_transformation_forward_with_launch_of_industrys_first_purchasing_card, Singapore ,"- DBS is pressing ahead with its efforts to support the digital transformation of Singapore’s logistics sector amid the Covid-19 situation, launching today the DBS Logistics Purchasing Card (“DBS P-Card”) – Singapore’s first cashless purchasing card [1] for the logistics sector. The DBS P-Card provides logistics SMEs with a digital, near contact-free solution to settle payments and collections at container depots, removing the hassle of the current manual, cash-based process. It is estimated that each driver can save around 30 minutes each day on payment matters if the DBS P-Card is made available across all container depots in Singapore. Beyond the benefit of convenience, the DBS P-Card reduces drivers’ and cashiers’ exposure to bacteria and viruses from handling cash, providing added health and safety assurance especially during the ongoing Covid-19 situation. The DBS P-Card is part of DBS’ Digital Logistics Solutions Package which was launched at Logistics Disrupt in October 2019 to help address pain points experienced in Singapore’s logistics and supply chain ecosystem. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS, noted that operational inefficiencies from paper-based, manual payment and collection processes could hamper the growth ambitions of logistics SMEs once the Covid-19 situation stabilises. “These manual and paper-based processes are longstanding pain points in Singapore’s logistics and supply chain sector, and DBS has been working closely with industry partners to find workable solutions. The current economic lull due to the Covid-19 situation presents an opportunity for us to test and implement some of these solutions so that our logistics SMEs, which form the bedrock of Singapore as a global logistics hub, are in a better position to capture the uptick in business activity when the crisis passes.” Singapore has been ranked by the World Bank as Asia’s top logistics hub for 10 years in a row [2] , and the logistics sector accounts for about 7% of Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product [3] . This places Singapore favourably to ride on the projected growth of e-commerce in the region in the coming years [4] . SMEs in the logistics sector are looking to capture a slice of this growth by capitalising on the increasing need for transport and storage solutions. Yang Kee Logistics has signed on as the first customer to adopt this solution. The DBS P-Card will enable drivers and hauliers to completely digitise payments and collections at Yang Kee’s two container depots in Tuas – Pacific Trans and Container Connections. On average, Yang Kee processes over 25,000 payments each month at its two container depots. These payments are currently done manually and out of pocket with the use of physical cash. An estimated 1,000 drivers are expected to eventually benefit from using the DBS P-Card as DBS and Yang Kee engage haulage companies who use Yang Kee’s container depots. Koh Yang Kee, Executive Chairman and Founder of Yang Kee Logistics Pte Ltd, said, “As the largest locally owned logistics company in Singapore, Yang Kee is delighted to partner with DBS to introduce this much-needed innovation for Singapore’s logistics sector. The DBS P-Card streamlines the entire payment and collection process at our two container depots and benefits both our container depot staff and the drivers who use our container depots. The DBS P-Card is just one step in Yang Kee’s digital roadmap, and we look forward to working closely with DBS and our partners to further drive our digital transformation.” Ng Choon Eng, Managing Director of Rejoice Container Services, one of the haulage companies which has applied for the DBS P-Card said, “Our drivers can enjoy significant time-savings and convenience from using the DBS P-Card. With this solution, our drivers will be freed from the hassle of handling cash, which helps give additional peace of mind especially with the concerns around Covid-19. We hope more container depots will accept the DBS P-Card in the coming months so that the entire logistics sector can share these benefits.” Tee added, “We are pleased to be able to leverage our capabilities as the World’s Best Digital Bank to introduce a digital solution to address the payment and collection hassle faced by logistics companies. The positive feedback from Yang Kee and their haulage partners has been deeply encouraging and affirms the bank’s commitment to partnering logistics SMEs in their drive for digital transformation even throughout Covid-19. DBS will be looking to engage more companies to progressively extend this solution across the industry, and in the process, help with the transformation of Singapore’s logistics sector.” Today’s payment and collection process – manual, fragmented, and cumbersome Today, drivers typically carry about SGD 200-500 in petty cash on them to pay for a range of services at container depots, such as processing, handling, washing and repair charges, with drivers needing to queue at the cashier to pay for these services. Drivers with insufficient cash on them need to contact their office and either wait for additional cash or a cheque to be delivered, or for their office to transfer the shortfall to the container depot through bank transfer. These delays result in lost productivity and time which could have been better spent on higher value-added tasks. On the container depot’s end, the manual and fragmented collection process can lead to problems reconciling cash collected at the register and the actual services rendered. All physical cash and cheques received have to be brought to and deposited at a bank branch. DBS P-Card – simple, accurate, hassle-free payments The DBS P-Card addresses these pain points by enabling drivers to make payments with a simple tap of a card on the checkout terminal, not unlike tapping a card to board a bus. Drivers will no longer need to carry thick wads of cash or wait aimlessly at the container depot for their companies to resolve cash shortfalls. Container depots will not have to contend with reconciliation errors with collections done digitally and sums automatically credited into the container depot’s DBS corporate account the very next day. Container depots will also be able access holistic payment and collection data for the first time, allowing them to conduct more precise business analysis and forecasting. This also enhances security for the container depot while avoiding the need to pay for daily courier services to the bank.

DBS Bank prices the market’s first Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA)-referenced notes,06 May 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_prices_the_markets_first_Singapore_Overnight_Rate_Average_SORA_referenced_notes, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced that it has successfully priced the industry’s first SORA-referenced floating rate notes under its USD 30 billion Global Medium-Term Note Programme. The issue of the Notes supports the Association of Banks in Singapore and the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee (ABS-SFEMC)’s roadmap for the development of new SORA-based markets. On 30 August 2019, ABS-SFEMC announced that the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) would affect the sustainability of the SGD Swap Offer Rate (SOR) [1] and held a public consultation on the use of SORA as the new interest rate benchmark to replace SOR. More recently, the Steering Committee for SOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) published the response to feedback on 19 March 2020, together with a roadmap for the transition. SORA is a transaction-based interest rate benchmark underpinned by the SGD overnight interbank funding market and has been published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore since July 2005. As the first financial institution in Singapore to successfully price the issue of a SORA-referenced floating rate note, DBS Bank has taken the first step to pave the way for further SORA adoption. The Notes have a notional amount of SGD 20 million and a tenor of one year. The Notes will bear a coupon rate of Compounded Daily SORA + 0.65% per annum, payable quarterly in arrear with Compounded Daily SORA calculated using a five business day look-back observation period. Philip Fernandez, DBS Group Corporate Treasurer, said, “DBS Bank is pleased to have completed the pilot issuance of a SORA-referenced floating rate note. This is an important step in the industry’s plan to develop an active market for financial instruments linked to SORA. We will continue to work together with ABS-SFEMC to encourage adoption of SORA-based products.” The Notes are expected to be issued on 14 May 2020 and the net proceeds from the issue of the Notes will be used for the general business purposes of the DBS Group. DBS Bank was mandated as Structuring Advisor and Sole Lead Manager for the offering of the Notes. The Notes have been offered to certain non-U.S. investors outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are expected to be rated Aa1 by Moody's Investors Services Inc. and AA- by Fitch Ratings Ltd. Application will be made to the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) for the listing and quotation of the Notes on the SGX-ST. There is no guarantee that an application to the SGX-ST will be approved. Admission of the Notes to the Official List of the SGX-ST is not to be taken as an indication of the merits of DBS Bank, the Programme or the Notes. The SGX-ST assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any statement made, opinions expressed or reports contained herein.

"DBS first-quarter total income rises 13%, crossing SGD 4 billion for the first time; profit before allowances up 20% to new high",30 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_quarter_total_income_rises_13pct_crossing_SGD_4_billion_for_the_first_time_profit_before_allowances_up_20pct_to_new_high," Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, China, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group reported net profit of SGD 1.17 billion for first-quarter 2020, a 29% decline from a year ago, as it pre-emptively set aside a further SGD 703 million of general allowances for risks arising from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The charge increased the amount of general allowance reserves by 29% to SGD 3.23 billion to fortify the balance sheet. Total income grew 13% from a year ago to a new high of SGD 4.03 billion. Business momentum was healthy with broad-based growth in non-trade corporate loans and fee income. Gains from investment securities also contributed to the increase in total income. Net interest income increased 7% from a year ago and 2% from the previous quarter to SGD 2.48 billion. Loans grew 1% or SGD 3 billion in constant-currency terms from the previous quarter to SGD 369 billion. Non-trade corporate loans grew 5% from drawdowns in Singapore and Hong Kong, which were offset by declines in trade loans and wealth management customer loans. Net interest margin was stable from the previous quarter at 1.86%. While the US Fed cut policy rates to near-zero in March, Libor interbank rates were resilient due to stressed funding market conditions, which buffered net interest margin. Fee income grew 14% from a year ago to a new high of SGD 832 million. The growth was led by a 31% increase in wealth management fees, a 17% rise in loan-related fees, and a 64% increase in investment banking fees. Card fees declined 8% due to lower transactions across the region. Other non-interest income increased 39% from a year ago to SGD 712 million. Expenses rose 4% from a year ago to SGD 1.56 billion. Compared to the previous quarter it fell 3% from lower staff costs. The positive jaw of nine percentage points compared to a year ago and 19 percentage points compared to the previous quarter lowered the cost-income ratio to 39%. Profit before allowances grew 20% to SGD 2.47 billion. Total allowances of SGD 1.09 billion were taken to accelerate the build-up of reserves. Two-thirds of the amount or SGD 703 million were for general allowances to anticipate a deeper and more prolonged economic impact from the pandemic. The remaining SGD 383 million was for specific allowances, mainly for new exposures recognised as non-performing during the quarter. Non-performing assets rose 14% from the previous quarter to SGD 6.59 billion, with two percentage points of the increase due to currency effects. The NPL rate rose from 1.5% in the previous quarter to 1.6%. Total allowance reserves increased 21% to SGD 6.08 billion and allowance coverage was at 92%. When collateral valued at SGD 3.08 billion was taken into account, allowance coverage was at 173%. Liquidity remained healthy. Deposits recorded the highest quarterly increase, rising 7% or SGD 30 billion in constant-currency terms from the previous quarter to SGD 445 billion. A majority of the growth was from corporate customers. Deposits from wealth management and retail customers also increased as they shifted from investments to cash. The loan-deposit ratio declined from 89% in the previous quarter to 83%. The liquidity coverage ratio of 133% and net stable funding ratio of 112% were both above regulatory requirements. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio declined 0.2 percentage points from the previous quarter to 13.9%. The ratio was above the group’s target operating range as well as regulatory requirements. The leverage ratio of 6.9% was more than twice the regulatory minimum of 3%. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share, unchanged from the previous quarter. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “Our record operating performance in the first quarter has given us a head start to face the challenges of the coming year. While the economic outlook remains uncertain and credit risks have increased, the digital investments we have made have strengthened the resilience and efficiency of our franchise and we remain committed to serving our customers. We will maintain a solid balance sheet with ample capital, liquidity and loss allowance reserves that give us strong buffers to absorb external shocks.” [END]  About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS unveils new digital financial planning proposition to provide personalised financial advisory for all,29 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_unveils_new_digital_financial_planning_proposition_to_provide_personalised_financial_advisory_for_all, Singapore ,"- All five million DBS/POSB customers can now access DBS’ new digital financial planning solution NAV Planner within their internet and mobile banking accounts. NAV Planner – an industry-first, feature-rich digital advisory solution leveraging big data and technology – enables customers to independently plan and monitor their financial goals by guiding them through insights and recommendations tailored to their life stages and financial circumstances. This is complemented by the bank’s extensive digital library of knowledge materials and financial literacy programmes. “Technology has helped the insurance, brokerage and wealth management industries scale up and reach more customers with their services. But we've noticed that even with digitalisation, financial information is still held in silos. Those who wish to review their overall finances either need to manually consolidate their holdings or look to their financial advisors to do so for them. Others who are not subscribed to these services are inadvertently left out,” said Jeremy Soo, DBS’ Singapore Head of Consumer Banking Group. “This is where we believe we can make a difference. NAV Planner leverages our digital expertise and data analytics to create a digital advisor for everyone that can not only consolidate, but also analyse and recommend.” Many in Singapore have been hard hit by Covid-19, and concerns over financial planning and having adequate protection for themselves and their loved ones have since surfaced. During this unprecedented time when most of Singapore is staying home, our new digital ‘contact-less’ financial planning solution will come in handy.” Helping customers get their fundamentals right  NAV Planner is guided by DBS’ proprietary financial planning framework which comprises principles developed by the bank’s financial planning experts and employs the Financial Planning Association of Singapore’s (FPAS) benchmarks. It has identified seven typical streams on what customers do with their money, of which the first-phase launch will focus on three: budgeting and savings; protection; and investments. By proactively managing their finances around these three streams, customers can achieve their longer-term financial aspirations such as purchasing a home, or accumulating a retirement nest egg, more easily. Through interacting with NAV planner, customers can see for themselves how a decision made in one stream can potentially affect outcomes in others. More importantly, it helps them visualise how smaller day-to-day financial decisions can lead to a substantial impact on longer-term financial goals. This fluid, adaptive approach is developed based on feedback DBS received from extensive and deep customer immersions and engagements. “We noticed that most people tend to only engage with their finances on an ‘episodic’ basis, that is when they need to make important money decisions, and this is something we would like to course-correct,” added Soo. “We believe that helping our customers review their smaller everyday financial decisions will stand them in good stead and protect their finances against a drain from unexpected volatilities, such as the current pandemic.” How NAV Planner works – A personal financial advisor in your pocket  NAV Planner is an evolution of its predecessor, Your Financial GPS [1] . Integrated into DBS/POSB internet banking and digibank app, the enhanced solution provides customers with a personalised balance sheet, which gives a full overview of their cash savings, loans, insurance protection plans and current investments as they are held with the bank. Customers are also able to include external holdings to complete their balance sheet view. Customers can click through each section to find out more about their money habits, and have the option to add to what has already been captured automatically under each category . Using the balance sheet as a basis, NAV Planner will then provide users with insights, analyses and suggestions unique to them. Its guided advisory capability helps customers get started on their insurance and investments needs – which traditionally require face-to-face consultations – by computing whether the user has adequate protection coverage or funds to put towards investments, based on their life-stage. Upon identifying any gaps, NAV Planner will recommend suitable solutions and relevant educational guides for the customer. It also provides a dashboard view of the customer’s entire investment portfolio – breaking down the different instruments they have, together with each instrument’s monthly performance. This feature is the first-of-its-kind to be offered to retail customers. A consolidated view of a user’s investment portfolio and aggregated monthly performance; the first-of-its-kind offered to retail customers in Singapore “Over the next few months, we will enhance existing functionalities and provide a new integrated retirement planning tool that helps customers better visualise and plan for their golden years,” said Evy Wee, Head of Personal Finance and Investing, DBS Bank. “Singaporeans now have longer life expectancy, and we want to go beyond focusing on immediate financial needs, which are addressed by many personal finance tools today.

"Physically apart, but always TOGETHER - DBS launches employee movement to keep morale high amid Covid-19",28 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Physically_apart_but_always_TOGETHER_DBS_launches_employee_movement_to_keep_morale_high_amid_Covid19, Singapore ,"- DBS is galvanising its 12,000 strong workforce in Singapore amid Covid-19 with the launch of its TOGETHER movement – the bank’s holistic approach to employee care and engagement during these challenging times. The movement also aims to encourage employees to imagine and prepare for future opportunities and growth post Covid-19. Aldea Zhang joins her in-bank mentor for a coaching session via the bank’s videoconferencing platform. Lee Yan Hong, Head of Group Human Resources at DBS, shared that while the bank’s employees are doing their best to adapt to new work norms as a result of Covid-19, some may experience anxiety when juggling competing demands for attention as the boundaries between home and the workplace start to blur. “Managing these changes to our daily routines may not come naturally to everyone. The lack of social interaction at the workplace coupled with the wider uncertainty over how the pandemic situation might change the economy and our social norms add to the mental and emotional stress that employees might experience.” “We are committed to looking after our employees’ well-being, even as we continue to serve our customers. Our employees are our most valuable asset, and this is why we have intensified our efforts to communicate and engage with them during this challenging time. Our aim is to keep everyone connected and engaged, to encourage mutual care, and to inspire our employees to reimagine and create opportunities for growth after Covid-19, rather than be constrained by today’s circumstances.” DBS’ TOGETHER movement seeks to boost employee morale through a holistic series of programmes aimed at addressing their physical, emotional, mental and psychological well-being. The programmes’ four main themes involve helping employees: (1) Adopt new behaviours and ways of working. With teams operating virtually out of different sites, this track aims to establish new norms to ensure a respectful and productive digital work environment. DBS has rolled out a communications programme containing advice on smoothening the transition to new work arrangements, such as ways to organise work corners at home and suggestions on establishing new work routines. Managers have also received guidance on how to better engage their teams remotely, including actionable tips on building team morale as well as insights on cultivating trust and empathy from behind the screen. (2) Build social connections despite new work arrangements. The lack of physical meetups or face-to-face conversations could hinder team bonding, but this track aims to introduce new ways for employees to stay connected and build professional trust. DBS has encouraged employees to leverage the bank’s videoconferencing platforms to stay connected socially, of which employees have responded positively, such as organising virtual team meals and group fitness exercises. “Casual Hangouts” sessions have also been organised to bring employees with common interests (such as having a love for animals, good food and doing good) together. Managers are encouraged the lead the change by introducing new team habits and celebrating positive milestones. (3) Care for their personal well-being, and that of colleagues. Working remotely has its own set of challenges that can take a toll on physical and mental health. This track reminds employees to take charge of their personal health during this period, and to nurture a culture of mutual care and concern within the organisation. DBS has been distributing care packages comprising surgical masks, hand sanitisers, a thermometer and Vitamin C supplements to all employees. Webinars on health and well-being in the context of a Covid-19 world have also been organised regularly. Confidential counselling, which has always been available to employees, continue to be available during this period. Programmes focused on mental well-being will also be introduced in the coming weeks (more details in subsequent sections). (4) Use current circumstances as a positive force to develop innovative solutions for the bank, customers and community. This track aims to encourage employees to see themselves as agents of positive change even during Covid-19. These include internal innovation challenges as well as avenues for employees to contribute to the wider community. DBS has roped in its employees to distribute complimentary care packages , healthy snacks, lunch bentos, coffee and gelato to healthcare professionals who have been working tirelessly in the wake of the Covid-19 situation. Through its SGD 10.5 million ‘DBS Stronger Together Fund’, the bank is empowering its employees to donate towards meals for the elderly, lower-income households, and migrant workers in Singapore. DBS is further amplifying employee contributions by matching every employee meal pledge made. Overcoming adversity TOGETHER – a unifying movement recognising the collective bank-wide effort to face the challenges of Covid-19 Lee added that the bank has been rolling out various initiatives to care for employees ever since the Covid-19 situation began unfolding in early February 2020. At the same time, employees have been coming up with creative ways of their own to stay connected and keep morale high. “It is uplifting to see our employees being so positive in the face of adversity, and we want to encourage more of such socially proactive behaviour. Our TOGETHER movement will provide a unifying focal point to channel our collective effort across the bank into programmes that have the most impact on our employees.” Ground-up initiatives have been springing up, with employees tapping on the bank’s videoconferencing platforms to come up with new team rituals to keep morale high. For instance, one department holds weekly Fast Food Fridays with everyone sharing their lunch and catching up virtually, while others hold virtual book clubs to connect outside of work conversations. Another team has also developed a mobile game application to remind each other of appropriate social behaviours during Covid-19. Aldea Zhang, a Management Associate at DBS, said, “I was initially quite excited to know that we could work from home as it’s a new experience for me. But after a week, I found myself missing my colleagues as well as the opportunity to learn from the experiences of the different people I get to meet when I go to work. We don’t know how long the pandemic will last, and how long we will need to keep to these new work arrangements, so it’s really reassuring to know that the bank has got our backs with structured ways to help us adapt.” Supporting employees’ mental well-being during Covid-19 Employees can look forward to more engagement activities as part of the TOGETHER movement in the coming weeks, including programmes around innovation, career development, wellness and mental health. On mental well-being, Lee emphasised that mental health is just as important as physical health, especially during this period. “The isolation economy is a reality that all of us must contend with for the foreseeable future, until we have certainty on when the pandemic could pass. Until then, DBS is committed to devoting sufficient resources and energy into ensuring that the mental health needs of our employees are adequately addressed.” From next month onwards, employees will be given free access to a mindfulness application tailored to workplace mental wellness as part of the bank’s holistic support for employee well-being. DBS will also launch a well-being challenge between mid-May to mid-June to encourage all employees to take charge of their own physical and mental health. Michelle Tan, Vice President, Group Strategic Marketing and Communications at DBS, shared that working from home over the past month made her realise that she had to adjust not just her schedule but also her mindset to fit the needs of everyone in her household, which includes two toddlers aged four and one. “I thought working from home would mean I could have extra time with my kids and more time to exercise as I would be cutting down on my commuting time. But over the last month, I realised that it does take some effort to make sure my schedule and the kids’ schedules are planned properly so that I don’t get overwhelmed with what’s happening on my laptop and outside in the living room where the kids are. I’m thankful that the bank understands my concerns and is introducing programmes specifically looking at mental well-being. I think many employees will find this useful as burnout is a very real issue if you need to constantly juggle work and home at the same time.” Making digital learning the new norm in skills advancement DBS will also nudge employees to make the most of today’s new work arrangements by ingraining digital learning behaviours during this period. The bank is running its inaugural ‘LearnShareTeach TOGETHER’ Virtual Festival all of this week to encourage its employees in Singapore to pick up new skills, and to connect with colleagues through the sharing of knowledge and experiences. Employees can also look forward to building their own autonomous driving models in a 3D simulation environment, followed by a competition on a virtual racetrack to learn about machine learning in a fun, gamified way. The bank will also be looking to sustain the habit of digital learning beyond the festival with fortnightly learning ‘playlists’. These are curated selections of bite-sized learning modules, videos, and virtual classes on topics such as blockchain, digital disruption and the science of decision-making. These playlists will be put together from DBS’ collection of over 10,000 articles on the bank’s digital Learning Hub.

"BKPM maintains commitment to facilitating investment, partners with Bank DBS Indonesia | Bahasa",22 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/BKPM_maintains_commitment_to_facilitating_investment_partners_with_Bank_DBS_Indonesia, Indonesia ,"- Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) Chairman Bahlil Lahadalia and DBS Bank Indonesia President Director Paulus Sutisna today (22/4) signed a cooperation agreement to increase foreign direct investment and strengthen economic relations between Indonesia and the countries where DBS Bank and its affiliates operate. The agreement was signed remotely through a video conference call. Bahlil said that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the BKPM maintains the commitment to facilitating investor needs to ensure that investment continues to flow and supports the nation’s economy. The current Covid-19 situation has not prevented the BKPM from performing its task of safeguarding investment. “We would like to thank you for this cooperation initiative. The Covid-19 pandemic has definitely impacted investment growth in Indonesia. Although investment realization grew in the first quarter of 2020, foreign investment (PMA) declined. Through this cooperation with DBS, we hope to create synergy and exchange information to support efforts to accelerate investment in Indonesia,” said Bahlil in his speech. Under the cooperation agreement, investors can gain several benefits, including information regarding policies and regulations on capital investment, as well as education on banking services they need. Investors also will be facilitated in processing their licenses, meeting regulatory requirements and banking activation, as well as handling of problems encountered in realizing their investment. “As one of the largest banks in Asia, our reach spans the region where we are confident we can play an active role, not only in promoting investment but also in facilitating foreign investment in Indonesia as well as capital investment by national business players in various countries where DBS operates,” said DBS Bank Indonesia President Director Paulus Sutisna. In addition, investors will be equipped with economic knowledge, such as quarterly market and industry updates by DBS Bank economists, as well as advice on banking regulations that include Financial Services Authority’s (OJK) routine updates and the central bank’s regulations and requirements. The cooperation between the BKPM and DBS Bank Indonesia also covers an ecosystem of supply chain connectivity to promote local small and medium-sized businesses (UKM). Bahlil said that the joint agreement was carried out to attract foreign investment into Indonesia. With many DBS Bank customers abroad, BKPM hopes that DBS Bank attracts incoming investors and subsequently the Government’s obligation to facilitate investor’s needs, accelerate licensing, provide necessary information related to investment. “This is my first time signing a partnership with banking. This is not limited to signing, but also we immediately contribute positively to the nation and state.  We both realize a better Indonesia,” said Bahlil responding to the questions from the media. With this cooperation, DBS Bank Indonesia will provide services for investors, such as account opening with a one-door application, transactional banking solution as digital solution, trading services, and cash management. This cooperation also covers promotional activity and banking services development which is available in DBS Bank Indonesia. “Cooperation between BKPM and DBS Bank Indonesia in line with our goals to run a sustainable business. Through this joint promotion, DBS Bank as a trusted business partner, wants to give the most advanced and trusted banking services for customers and potential investors by giving service facilities and products that simplify business in investing. We expect to play a very active role to support customer’s business development, as well as encourage economic growth in the country through the increased growth of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) development in Indonesia,” said Paulus Sutisna, President Director of DBS Bank Indonesia.

星展銀行（台灣）致力節能減碳，再推「食物零浪費」倡議打造永續環境,21 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/20200421_DBS_Taiwan_sustainability_zero_food_waste, Taiwan ,"- 星展銀行致力環境永續，以追求社會均衡發展、對自然環境及未來世代負責任的態度，來經營銀行業務，除了於公司日常營運中落實永續精神，星展更積極結合員工與客戶，創造更大的社會響力。今年適逢世界地球日50周年，星展銀行也在永續主軸之下，發起新的倡議「食物零浪費」（ZeroFoodWaste），呼籲大眾從源頭開始珍惜食物，並透過預防舉措，讓資源達到更好的運用。 星展銀行（台灣）企業及機構銀行處處長暨永續委員會主席羅綸有指出，星展秉持「負責任的銀行業務」、「負責任的商業實務」與「創造社會影響力」三大永續發展重心，打造長久的社會價值。為了降低在營運過程中所產生的環境衝擊，星展銀行（台灣）致力落實各項節能減碳措施，並進一步結合銀行本業，發行永續指數連結貸款、參與再生能源聯貸案、推出綠色存款。今年，星展也決定提出「食物零浪費」倡議，號召社會大眾珍惜、善用食物，共創地球永續。 星展銀行於2018年宣布加入全球再生能源倡議計畫「RE100」，是首家加入該計畫的亞洲銀行。「RE100」由氣候組織（Climate Group）與碳揭露計畫（CDP）聯合發起，目前已有超過100家企業皆承諾持續提升再生能源的使用，邁向低碳經濟。 為了降低在營運過程對環境產生衝擊，星展銀行（台灣）每年編列預算汰換老舊、耗電量較高的空調主機設備，並委任外部專家健檢星展銀行（台灣）能源使用態樣，透過大數據分析找出樽節能源的重點，並據此發起節電比賽，將全行區分為63個區域，號召全行員工身體力行節約能源。2019年上半年，在全行員工努力下，星展銀行（台灣）較前一年度減少6.7%，相當於20萬度、或是50個四口之家一整年的用電量。 同時，星展銀行（台灣）也連續第12年響應由世界自然基金會發起的「地球一小時」（Earth Hour），於3月底於所有後勤辦公室、走廊與公共休憩空間熄燈1小時，並在晚間關閉所有分行招牌燈1小時。行舍建築端，星展銀行（台灣）總部辦公室與星展豐盛私人客戶服務旗艦分行，均獲得美國綠建築協會LEED綠色建築認證，且星展銀行（台灣）台中太平分行屋頂，更直接建置太陽能發電設備，自電自用，發電總計涵蓋該分行45%之用電量。 2020年，星展在既有的永續發展主軸下，進一步提出「食物零浪費」倡議。羅綸有表示，根據聯合國糧農組織(FAO, Food and Agriculture organization of the United Nations)統計，全球每年約有13億噸食物從採收到消費的過程中被浪費。雖然台灣在處理廚餘回收、再利用已頗有成效，但今年受到新冠病毒疫情影響，許多農產品無法外銷而久放腐敗、面臨銷毀的命運。且大量外觀不佳的蔬果，儘管品質和口感依舊，也會因不符合市場規格而被淘汰，形成浪費。因此，星展銀行期望透過「食物零浪費」倡議，攜手員工、客戶和社企夥伴，從產地、運輸、食物加工、銷售到餐桌的食物旅程環節中，著手預防剩食的產生，並透過再製、再利用，極大化糧食價值，共同打造永續生態圈。 星展銀行（台灣）對永續的推動與努力，亦於2019年底獲得財團法人台灣永續能源研究基金會頒發「台灣永續典範外商企業獎」肯定。"
DBS donates SGD 10.5 million to help communities hard hit by Covid-19,16 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_donates_SGD_10_5_million_to_help_communities_hard_hit_by_Covid19," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank announced today that it will be donating SGD 10.5 million to help communities hard hit by Covid-19 across the region. Through the “DBS Stronger Together Fund”, the bank will provide about 4.5 million meals and care packs to affected individuals across its six key markets, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. In India and Indonesia, where medical supplies are severely lacking, DBS will also fund the procurement of diagnostic test kits, ventilators and protective gear to help in the fight against Covid-19. In addition to its donations, across the region, DBS is also rallying employees behind the cause, with a pledge to match funds raised. Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “As we look across the region, Covid-19 is creating tremendous hardship for many, impacting both lives and livelihoods. In some of our markets, such as Indonesia and India, there is an acute shortage of medical supplies such as test kits, which is forcing healthcare workers to fight the Covid war blind. In other markets, including here in Singapore, the plight of the vulnerable has been exacerbated and some segments of the population are going hungry. The needs are truly enormous, and many in society have come forward to make a difference. As a key member of the community, we too want to stand in solidarity with our employees, clients and fellow Singaporeans to help those impacted, until the day we get through this crisis together.” According to The Food Bank Singapore, the Covid-19 situation has resulted in an increase in demand for food support as more people are placed on no-pay leave or made redundant. On its part, The Food Bank Singapore, which distributes dry food rations or fresh produce to some 360 beneficiary organisations islandwide, has seen monetary and food donations fall sharply. To address this, DBS is partnering The Food Bank Singapore and ItsRainingRaincoats in an SGD 2.5 million initiative to put food on the tables of the elderly, low-income and migrant workers. For a start, the bank will provide 200,000 meals to the elderly and low-income through The Food Bank Singapore’s “Feed the City – DBS Edition” programme. These meals will be procured from 15 F&B outlets, including Koufu Group, Chang Cheng Group, Wee Nam Kee and Gao Ji, which are SME clients of DBS. Hence, apart from providing food to those in need, DBS will also be giving much-needed support to the hard-hit F&B sector. Through “Project Belanja”, another 100,000 meals will be provided to migrant workers supported by ItsRainingRaincoats. A call by DBS to its employees to stand together in doing good will go out next week, with every employee meal pledge matched by the bank. DBS also hopes that the public will come alongside it: public donations towards meals for the elderly and lower-income can be made at https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/dbsfeedthecity , while donations towards meals for migrant workers can be made at https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/dbsprojectbelanja . The bank will match dollar-for-dollar public funds raised for the two food programmes, up to a total of SGD 500,000. With the support of employees and fellow Singaporeans, DBS aims to provide a total of 700,000 meals to those in need. Said Ms Nichol Ng, co-founder of The Food Bank Singapore “The Covid-19 situation has largely affected our ability to reach out to the beneficiaries as we are running low on food and funds. As their level of food supply has dropped, we have also noted more requests from beneficiaries as they are unable to put food on the table during these uncertain times. Through DBS’ support, we can continue to run our ‘Feed the City’ programme, and to meet the basic needs of those affected.” Said Dipa Swaminathan, founder of ItsRainingRaincoats, “I am delighted and humbled by the magnificent support extended by DBS Bank to our migrant workers during the current Covid crisis. There are close to 750,000 migrant workers in Singapore and only a fraction of those are in the gazetted dorms. Many workers who are lodged elsewhere continue to need assistance with food during this time for various reasons: they are in quarantine and not able to access food, they are without funds to buy groceries or unable to cook due to shutting down of communal kitchens, etc. Our team of volunteers has been working around the clock to support any such worker who appeals to us in hunger through Project Belanja. We are hugely fortified in this battle now with the added support of DBS and confident that together we will help our workers and in doing so, help our entire community overcome this crisis.” In February, amid the Covid-19 crisis, DBS worked with social enterprises it supports to deliver care packages and F&B treats to hospitals and communities across Singapore. That initiative benefitted over 32,000 healthcare professionals as well as the underprivileged. DBS also has a longstanding history of supporting the elderly, low-income and migrant workers through its bank and community programmes. For example, its employee volunteer programme has partnered Lion’s Befrienders and Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre since 2015. In Singapore, DBS’ subsidiary POSB is the only bank that works with the Ministry of Manpower to provide banking services to migrant workers and foreign domestic workers. Appendix 1 The following is a list of the 15 F&B SMEs that DBS will procure meals from which will go towards the elderly and low-income, and which will be distributed by The Food Bank Singapore. Amra Catering Pte Ltd Andhra Heritage Pte Ltd Chang Cheng Group Gao Ji Pte Ltd Java Kitchen Pte Ltd Joe & Dough Pte Ltd JR Foods Pte Ltd Kim San Leng Group Kimly Group Koufu Group Qi Ji Group Sterling Trends & Concepts Pte Ltd Straits Chinese Nonya Restaurant Pte Ltd Tasty Loong Pte Ltd WNK F&B Management Pte Ltd Appendix 2 Here is a snapshot of what DBS is doing to help hard-hit communities in its other five key markets: Hong Kong : DBS is helping the elderly and at-risk groups, including low-income families, better cope with the impact of the pandemic. With about 1.2 million people in Hong Kong aged 65 or above, of whom close to one-half (44%) live in poverty before policy intervention, DBS will work with local charities Senior Citizen Home Safety Association and Foodlink Foundation, and social enterprise Agent of Change, to provide more than 30,000 care and food packs to vulnerable seniors and low-income families. DBS’ resources will also enable the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association to increase its Care-on-Call services by more than 20,000 service sessions, to better address the emotional and physical well-being of the elderly, who may face greater isolation or mobility challenges amid the outbreak. China : An early lockdown has been effective in arresting the spread of Covid-19. However, the move has still impacted senior citizens, especially those who live alone or who have financial difficulties. Low-income migrant workers, who normally travel from less developed provinces to larger cities to work have also been impacted by the temporary closure of factories and workplaces, and face concerns of job security and accessibility to daily necessities such as food. To help alleviate this, DBS is partnering NPI, Green Food Bank and others to launch a “Food for Care” programme, which will provide about 1.7 million meals to affected communities in the next 12 months. More than 50,000 low-income individuals will also receive support including personal hygiene kits and re-employment trainings. India : Amid a rising number of cases, testing kits and protective gear for staff carrying out diagnostic tests are in short supply, as are critical facilities and equipment. DBS is partnering with UNICEF, United Way, Metropolis Labs and others to help scale up public health infrastructure, provide medical supplies and equipment, and sponsor free testing for the underprivileged. Additionally, there is a large population of daily wage earners who have been affected by the pandemic as their income has been greatly reduced with the temporary closure of factories and workplaces. DBS is working with organisations such as Pratham, Akshaya Patra and United Way to provide the equivalent of two million meals in the form of food supplies, as well as pre-packaged meals, to the affected communities. Indonesia : The World Bank has estimated that the pandemic will throw millions of people into poverty. As of 7 April 2020, more than 1.2 million people have lost their jobs or income due to being placed on furlough. DBS Indonesia will partner with NGOs to provide about 275,000 meals to 11,500 daily wage workers in Jakarta, its surrounding areas, as well as West Java. The acute shortage of Covid-19 test kits has impacted the ability of healthcare workers to fight the pandemic. To address this, the bank will donate 100,000 units of a rapid test kit, polymerase chain reaction machines and other medical supplies to the Government of Indonesia. Taiwan : Although the pandemic is comparatively well controlled, older people who live alone in rural areas are going hungry, being unable to go to community centres to have group meals provided by NPOs/NGOs. The food delivery system is also affected by the pandemic. In addition, many people have lost their jobs and their livelihoods have been impacted. DBS Taiwan plans to donate 45,000 food packs to those in need. The food pack contains rice, noodles, fish floss, corn crackers and hand sanitiser. All products are purchased from social enterprises.

"DBS sumbang SGD 10,5 juta untuk bantu masyarakat terdampak Covid-19",16 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_sumbang_SGD_105_juta_untuk_bantu_masyarakat_terdampak_Covid19, Indonesia ,"- Bank DBS pada Kamis lalu (16/4) mengumumkan akan menyumbang SGD 10,5 juta untuk membantu masyarakat yang terdampak oleh Covid-19 di berbagai tempat. Melalui “DBS Stronger Together Fund”, perusahaan akan menyediakan sekitar 4,5 juta paket makanan dan perawatan untuk individu terdampak di enam negara utama di mana Bank DBS beroperasi, yaitu Singapura, Hongkong, Tiongkok, India, Indonesia, dan Taiwan. Di India dan Indonesia, di mana pasokan medis sangat terbatas, DBS juga akan mendanai pengadaan alat tes diagnostik, ventilator, dan alat pelindung untuk membantu perang melawan Covid-19. Selain donasi, DBS juga mengajak karyawan untuk turut memberikan donasi, di mana jumlah yang terkumpul akan digandakan oleh perusahaan. CEO DBS, Piyush Gupta mengatakan, “Sebagaimana yang kita cermati di seluruh wilayah operasional, Covid-19 menyebabkan kesulitan luar biasa bagi banyak orang, yang berdampak pada kehidupan dan mata pencaharian. Di beberapa negara di mana kami beroperasi, seperti Indonesia dan India, terdapat kekurangan pasokan perlengkapan medis seperti testkit , sehingga memaksa petugas kesehatan untuk berperang melawan Covid tanpa perlengkapan yang memadai. Di tempat lain, termasuk Singapura, nasib masyarakat yang rentan semakin memburuk dan beberapa kelompok masyarakat terancam mengalami kelaparan. Kebutuhan benar-benar sangat besar, dan banyak masyarakat berinisiatif untuk melakukan perubahan. Sebagai bagian dari masyarakat, kami juga ingin bergabung dalam solidaritas bersama karyawan, nasabah, dan sesama warga Singapura untuk membantu mereka yang terdampak, sampai dengan hari di mana kita dapat melewati krisis ini bersama.” Berdasarkan data Food Bank Singapore, situasi Covid-19 mengakibatkan adanya kenaikan permintaan akan bantuan makanan karena semakin banyak orang yang diharuskan mengambil cuti tanpa gaji atau kehilangan pekerjaan. Terkait hal ini, Food Bank Singapore, yang mendistribusikan jatah makanan kering atau produk segar kepada sekitar 360 organisasi penerima sumbangan di seluruh wilayah Singapura, mengamati bahwa jumlah sumbangan uang dan makanan menurun tajam. Untuk mengatasi hal ini, DBS bekerja sama dengan Food Bank Singapore dan ItsRainingRaincoats dalam menjalankan sebuah inisiatif senilai SGD 2,5 juta untuk membagikan makanan kepada para lansia, masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah, dan pekerja migran. Sebagai permulaan, DBS akan menyediakan 200.000 porsi makanan untuk lansia dan masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah melalui program “Feed the City - DBS Edition” yang dicanang Food Bank Singapore. Makanan akan diperoleh dari lima belas toko makanan dan minuman, termasuk Koufu Group, Chang Cheng Group, Wee Nam Kee, dan Gao Ji, yang merupakan klien DBS SME. Dengan demikian, selain memberikan bantuan makanan untuk yang membutuhkan, DBS juga memberikan dukungan yang sangat dibutuhkan bagi sektor makanan dan minuman yang terkena dampak cukup parah. Melalui “Project Belanja”, 100.000 porsi makanan lainnya akan diberikan kepada pekerja migran yang didukung oleh ItsRainingRaincoats. DBS mengajak seluruh karyawan untuk bergabung melakukan kebaikan yang dilaksanakan dalam pekan ini, di mana komitmen karyawan akan digandakan oleh perusahaan. DBS juga berharap publik dapat ikut serta: sumbangan dari publik untuk lansia dan masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah dapat diberikan melalui https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/dbsfeedthecity , sementara sumbangan makanan untuk pekerja migran dapat diberikan melalui https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/dbsprojectbelanja . DBS akan memberikan sumbangan dana yang diperoleh untuk dua program pangan tersebut, hingga mencapai total SGD 500.000 dolar. Melalui dukungan dari karyawan dan sesama warga Singapura, DBS menargetkan untuk dapat menyediakan total 700.000 porsi makanan kepada mereka yang membutuhkan. Co-founder Food Bank Singapore, Ms Nichol Ng mengatakan, “Situasi Covid-19 sangat mempengaruhi kemampuan kami untuk menjangkau para penerima bantuan, karena kami kehabisan makanan dan anggaran. Sebagaimana pasokan makanan mereka menurun, kami juga mencatat lebih banyak permintaan dari para penerima bantuan, karena mereka tidak mampu memenuhi kebutuhan makanan selama waktu yang tidak pasti ini. Melalui dukungan Bank DBS, kami dapat terus menjalankan program “Feed the City”, dan memenuhi kebutuhan dasar bagi mereka yang terdampak.”  Founder ItsRainingRaincoats, Dipa Swaminathan mengatakan, “Dengan rendah hati kami menerima dukungan luar biasa yang diberikan oleh Bank DBS kepada para pekerja migran selama situasi krisis Covid ini. Terdapat hampir 750.000 pekerja di Singapura dan hanya sebagian kecil dari mereka yang tinggal di asrama. Banyak pekerja yang tinggal di tempat lain dan terus membutuhkan bantuan makanan selama masa sulit ini karena berbagai alasan: mereka menjalani karantina dan tidak dapat mengakses makanan, mereka tidak memiliki dana untuk membeli bahan makanan atau tidak dapat memasak karena penutupan dapur umum, dan lain-lain. Tim relawan kami bekerja sepanjang waktu untuk membantu setiap pekerja yang meminta bantuan karena kelaparan, melalui Project Belanja. Kami merasa sangat dibantu dalam menangani situasi ini dengan dukungan tambahan dari DBS dan kami percaya bahwa bersama-sama kita dapat membantu para pekerja, dan dengan melakukan hal ini, kita dapat membantu seluruh lapisan masyarakat mengatasi krisis ini.” Pada bulan Februari, di tengah krisis Covid-19, Bank DBS bekerja sama dengan wirausaha sosial binaannya untuk mengirimkan care package , serta makanan dan minuman untuk rumah sakit dan masyarakat di seluruh wilayah Singapura. Inisiatif tersebut diberikan kepada lebih dari 32.000 tenaga kesehatan profesional serta kelompok masyarakat yang kurang mampu. Bank DBS juga memiliki sejarah yang panjang dalam mendukung lansia, masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah, dan pekerja migran melalui program perusahaan dan komunitas. Sebagai contoh, program sukarelawan karyawan DBS bekerja sama dengan Lion’s Befrienders dan Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre sejak 2015. Di Singapura, anak perusahaan DBS, POSB adalah satu-satunya bank yang bekerja dengan Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan untuk menyediakan layanan perbankan bagi para pekerja migran dan pekerja domestik asing.  Appendix 1 Berikut adalah daftar 15 wirausaha sosial di bidang makanan dan minuman yang akan menyediakan pasokan untuk DBS dan akan didistribusikan melalui Food Bank Singapore kepada lansia dan masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah. Amra Catering Pte Ltd Andhra Heritage Pte Ltd Chang Cheng Group Gao Ji Pte Ltd Kimly Group Kim San Leng Group Koufu Group Java Kitchen Pte Ltd Joe & Dough Pte Ltd JR Foods Pte Ltd Qi Ji Group Straits Chinese Nonya Restaurant Pte Ltd Sterling Trends & Concepts Pte Ltd Tasty Loong Pte Ltd WNK F&B Management Pte Ltd  Appendix 2 Berikut adalah cuplikan apa yang DBS lakukan untuk membantu masyarakat yang terdampak di lima negara: Hongkong: DBS membantu kelompok lansia dan yang berisiko, termasuk keluarga berpenghasilan rendah, dalam mengatasi dampak pandemi. Dengan lebih dari 1,2 juta orang di Hongkong yang berusia 65 tahun atau lebih, dan hampir setengahnya (44%) hidup dalam kemiskinan, DBS akan bekerja dengan lembaga swadaya masyarakat (LSM) lokal dan wirausaha sosial seperti Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, Foodlink Foundation, dan Agent of Change, untuk menyediakan lebih dari 30.000 paket kesehatan dan makanan untuk lansia yang rentan dan keluarga berpenghasilan rendah. Sumber daya DBS melalui Senior Citizen Home Safety Association juga akan memberikan 20.000 sesi layanan jangkauan tambahan, termasuk panggilan keluar dan kunjungan rumah perawat, untuk lebih menangani kesejahteraan emosional dan fisik lansia, yang mungkin menghadapi tantangan isolasi atau mobilitas yang lebih besar di tengah wabah. Tiongkok: Lockdown dini memiliki dampak signifikan dalam menghentikan penyebaran Covid-19. Namun, langkah tersebut masih berdampak pada warga lanjut usia, terutama mereka yang hidup sendiri atau yang memiliki kesulitan keuangan. Pekerja migran berpenghasilan rendah, yang biasanya bepergian dari provinsi yang kurang berkembang ke kota-kota yang lebih besar untuk bekerja, juga terpengaruh oleh penutupan sementara pabrik dan tempat kerja, dan menghadapi masalah keamanan kerja serta akses kepada kebutuhan sehari-hari seperti makanan. Untuk membantu meringankan beban, DBS bermitra dengan NPI, Green Food Bank, dan lainnya untuk meluncurkan program “Food for Care”, yang akan menyediakan sekitar 1,7 juta porsi makanan untuk masyarakat yang terkena dampak dalam 12 bulan ke depan. Lebih dari 50.000 individu berpenghasilan rendah juga akan menerima dukungan termasuk perlengkapan kebersihan pribadi dan pelatihan kerja. Indonesia: Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa pandemi akan membuat jutaan orang jatuh miskin. Pada 7 April 2020, lebih dari 1,2 juta orang telah kehilangan pekerjaan atau penghasilan. Bank DBS Indonesia akan bermitra dengan LSM untuk menyediakan sekitar 275.000 porsi makanan untuk 11.500 pekerja harian di Jakarta, daerah sekitarnya, serta Jawa Barat. Kekurangan alat tes Covid-19 mempengaruhi kemampuan petugas pelayanan kesehatan untuk memerangi pandemi. Untuk mengatasi hal ini, perusahaan akan menyumbangkan 100.000 unit alat rapid  test , mesin reaksi berantai polimerase, dan pasokan medis lainnya kepada pemerintah Indonesia. India: Di tengah meningkatnya jumlah kasus, alat uji dan alat pelindung diri bagi petugas kesehatan melakukan tes diagnostik tidak tersedia, demikian pula fasilitas dan peralatan penting. DBS bekerja sama dengan UNICEF, United Way, Metropolis Labs, dan lainnya untuk membantu meningkatkan infrastruktur kesehatan masyarakat, menyediakan pasokan dan peralatan medis, dan menyeponsori uji gratis bagi yang tidak mampu. Selain itu, ada populasi besar penerima upah harian yang terdampak oleh pandemi ini karena penghasilan mereka sangat berkurang dengan penutupan sementara pabrik dan tempat kerja. DBS bekerja sama dengan organisasi seperti Pratham, Akshaya Patra, dan United Way untuk menyediakan keseimbangan 2 juta makanan dalam bentuk pasokan makanan, serta makanan siap saji, bagi masyarakat terdampak. Taiwan: Meskipun pandemi terkendali dengan baik, lansia yang tinggal sendirian di daerah pedesaan mengalami kelaparan, tidak dapat pergi ke pusat-pusat komunitas untuk makan bersama sebagaimana disediakan oleh organisasi nirlaba atau LSM. Sistem pengiriman makanan juga dipengaruhi oleh pandemi. Selain itu, banyak orang kehilangan pekerjaan yang berdampak langsung terhadap kehidupan mereka. DBS Taiwan berencana untuk menyumbangkan 45.000 porsi makanan untuk mereka yang membutuhkan. Paket makanan berisi nasi, mie, abon, kerupuk jagung dan pembersih tangan. Semua produk dibeli dari wirausaha sosial.

DBS partners leading Chinese electronics manufacturer Haier to provide digital financing to its distributors within 24 hours,09 Apr 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_leading_Chinese_electronics_manufacturer_Haier_to_provide_digital_financing_to_its_distributors_within_24_hours," Singapore, China ","- To support the liquidity needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), DBS Bank has launched a digital financing facility with Haier Group (Haier), a leading Chinese consumer electronics and home appliances enterprise, to enable its ecosystem of distributors to access lower cost financing for their purchase orders in a simple and fast manner. This forms part of Haier’s and DBS’ broader regional relief efforts to help businesses, many of which are SMEs, to stay afloat during these challenging times. Accessible by Haier’s nationwide network of distributors via its digital supply chain platform, the integrated DBS financing facility enabled by the bank’s APIs offers distributors online financing for their purchase orders within 24 hours. This helps distributors shorten their cash conversion cycle and optimise their working capital. John Laurens, Group Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank said that providing financial sustenance to SMEs that form the commercial ecosystems of large corporates is of utmost importance in this unprecedented global trade situation. The DBS-Haier digital financing solution ensures that supply chains continue to operate in the face of disruptions. “Enhancing working capital management and access to financing is critical for both large corporates and SMEs especially in the current business environment. Technology has proven to be a useful tool in this aspect. By using DBS’ APIs to create an integrated financing facility plugged into an industry anchor’s supply chain platform, the benefits flow both ways. For Haier, their sales and distribution channels are given extra support; and for its SME distributors, they enjoy an extension on payment terms, helping them with essential cash flow and working capital management needs,” added Laurens. Yang Hongxing, Head of Supply Chain Finance, Haier Group, said, “DBS is the first foreign bank to cooperate with Haier's digital supply chain finance business. At the early onset of the pandemic, DBS took the initiative to accelerate the implementation of digital financing lines for our distributors, to get the funds they need with as little physical interaction as possible. The speed at which financing can be offered to our distributors and the ease of being onboarded, have also elevated our customer experience journey to new heights. With DBS’ digital financing facility, Haier’s customers can access low-cost financing with just a few clicks of the mouse. DBS and Haier’s Supply Chain Finance team will continue to jointly promote global cooperation in Haier's upstream and downstream supply chain finance going forward."" DBS saw close to 30 distributors onboarded on the fully digital financing facility targeting distributors in the first week of launch. Additional capabilities include integrated online account opening and onboarding, and facial recognition and biometric features for enhanced security. The bank has also completed its first distributor financing request in March, where the distributor received the requested financing in under 30 minutes from the point of submission. Laurens added, “The speed of financing gives businesses a fighting chance to tide through the downturn and emerge more resilient to ride the economic upturn when it returns.” DBS is the only non-Chinese bank appointed by Haier for this digital financing facility. The other three participating banks are China Everbright, Bank of Shanghai and MYBank. Committed to helping our customers transform digitally DBS has been steadily working with its corporate customers to digitalise their supply chain ecosystems and avail easy access to digital trade financing. Over the past year, the bank has launched several digital trade financing initiatives. To find out more, please see the following: • DBS launches its first multi-tier financing facility on blockchain platform to help SMEs in China get faster access to trade financing • DBS makes steady headway in digitalising trade; completes first fully digital trade financing settlement on Singapore’s networked trade platform with Audi Singapore and Premium Automobiles • DBS accelerates trade digitalisation efforts with more ‘industry-firsts’ to drive greater efficiencies for customers [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS rolls out digital relief package to help F&B businesses tap new income streams amid Covid-19,25 Mar 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_rolls_out_digital_relief_package_to_help_F_B_businesses_tap_new_income_streams_amid_Covid_19, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced a suite of digital solutions to support the F&B services industry which has about 8,000 establishments [1] impacted by tightened safe distancing measures as a result of the Covid-19 situation.  With Singapore residents being encouraged to change their eating habits from dining out to dining in, DBS is working with two homegrown technology startups, Oddle and FirstCom, to offer F&B businesses the ability to set up an online food ordering site in just three business days.  Supported by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Enterprise Singapore, DBS’ F&B digital relief package aims to help the F&B services industry go online, creating new income streams for them while catering to the nation’s growing need for takeaway and delivery meals.  Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS, said that through conversations with F&B clients and industry groups to understand their immediate challenges, she realised that the industry is grappling with fewer dine-in patrons due to stricter safe distancing measures implemented by the authorities as a result of the Covid-19 situation.  “The DBS F&B digital relief package elevates our support for the F&B community by creating an ecosystem of government partners and homegrown technology startups to help affected businesses overcome cashflow challenges by creating new income streams fast. The digital solutions in our package can be implemented with minimal lead time, allowing F&B businesses to tap into a rich online consumer base in just days rather than months. More than ever, SME banking today is more than just transactional relationships. It is about staying the course even when times are bad. In unprecedented times like these, DBS is actively rallying the industry to ensure the viability of our customers and their employees’ livelihoods,” Tee added   Unlocking new income streams for the F&B services industry through digital solutions    Oddle will support DBS’ F&B clients by establishing a branded e-menu with integrated shopping cart, order management and payment gateways in as few as three business days. This will allow merchants to immediately establish a digital presence and access previously untapped pools of online customers. Oddle will also ease the onboarding process to their F&B platform by providing training and a social media kit for merchants to further power online sales through digital marketing tools.  To access the DBS package, DBS’ F&B customers need only pay a preferential rate for these services, as compared to commission rates of as high as 30% on other industry digital platforms. Additionally, Oddle will also allow F&B SMEs the option to integrate with Oddle's preferred logistics partners who may want to ride on the growing preference for on-demand food delivery. Oddle’s system currently powers over 3,000 F&B brands, including Soup Restaurant, Arnold's Fried Chicken and A-One F&B.   FirstCom will help DBS’ F&B customers who already have an online presence to amplify their digital marketing efforts by offering merchants preferential rates for digital marketing services, which includes setting up and managing businesses’ social media presence on Facebook and Instagram. For F&B brands that are new to ecommerce, FirstCom will also be able to help them set up a digital presence in fewer than five working days.  With cashflow the lifeblood of an SME business, FirstCom will also integrate DBS’ digital merchant collections solution, DBS Max, as a payments and collections option in their respective ecommerce solutions. Additionally, DBS will absorb the set-up costs for DBS Max and waive Merchant Discount Rates for six months for FirstCom customers adopting DBS Max. FirstCom has served over 4,500 SME clients to date and has powered the digital marketing efforts of Singapore’s National Day Parade since 2017.  Jane Lim, Assistant Chief Executive, Sectoral Transformation Group, IMDA, said: “We are heartened to see the industry step up with efforts to encourage digital adoption in support of our call to “Stay Healthy, Go Digital”, such as DBS’ latest suite of offerings. In spite of the Covid-19 situation, we want to enable enterprises to carry on with their business operations as much as possible. Going digital is key; it not only allows our local SMEs to tide through the current climate, but also positions them to emerge stronger and more competitive when the economy recovers.”  Tee said that DBS is also exploring additional last mile delivery solutions for F&B merchants as the bank believes the current situation is bound to reshape dining patterns. This allows F&B businesses to offer their own on-demand food delivery services and better position them to ride on the growing norm of dining in.  Tee added, “As a result of Covid-19, consumer behaviour is likely to change as web-shy consumers are now pushed to embrace online food orders and doorstep deliveries. To adapt to the shifting business landscape, we are tapping into our digital capabilities as the World’s Best Digital Bank to empower our corporate customers to transform their businesses to keep pace with the changes. We are confident that today’s measures, coupled with our suite of digital payment and financing solutions, will help F&B businesses turn adversity into opportunity and place them in a stronger position to seize the growth opportunities that will emerge when this crisis passes.”  DBS’ F&B digital relief package is expected to be available by the end of March 2020, and the bank will be proactively engaging its F&B clients on how they can access these solutions. More details can be found at https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/covid-19-relief-measures/fb-digital-relief-package   DBS’ F&B digital relief package comes on the back of two rounds of relief measures to address cash flow challenges faced by the SME community. These liquidity relief measures include a six-month principal repayment moratorium for SME property loans announced on 13 February, and a collateral-free Digital Business Loan of up to SGD 50,000 disbursed within 24 hours of loan acceptance announced on 26 February.

In view of the foregoing, DBS Group Holdings announced today that it will restrict the number of attendees at the upcoming annual general meeting (AGM) scheduled to be held on 31 March 2020 at 2pm and offer an option for DBS’ shareholders to watch a live webcast of its AGM online. Due to the constantly evolving Covid-19 situation in Singapore, we may be required to change our AGM arrangements at short notice. Shareholders should check our DBS website for updates on our AGM. Participate in the AGM via live webcast Shareholders will be able to watch the proceedings through a live webcast via their mobile phones, tablets or computers. The webcast option will also help broaden the reach of DBS’ AGM by catering to shareholders who: i) are unable to attend the AGM due to the requirement to keep the number of participants at the AGM to below 250; ii) wish to watch the AGM proceedings but are concerned about the risk of Covid-19 transmission when attending large scale events; iii) are unable to attend the AGM due to Covid-19 restriction orders; and/ or iv) are overseas or unable to take leave to attend the physical AGM.

Shareholders who are not able to pre-register their (or their proxies’) attendance are encouraged to register to watch the live webcast. Other precautionary measures to be implemented at the AGM : In addition to the restriction of the number of attendees at the AGM to under 250, DBS will be undertaking the following precautionary measures to safeguard the health and well-being of shareholders (or their proxies) who are attending the AGM in person. (a)  Temperature screening/ health and travel declaration forms : Temperature screening (in addition to the venue’s thermal monitors) and the compulsory submission of travel and health declaration forms will be required. Any shareholder/ proxy who is detected to have a fever, or is exhibiting flu-like symptoms, will be denied entry. (b)  Safe distancing measures : Seats in the AGM venue will be placed at least 1 metre apart, and to facilitate contact tracing, we may assign seats to shareholders (or their representatives) who are in attendance. We will also have a queue management system where we will be spacing out of persons in the queue by at least 1 metre apart. (c)  No gift vouchers and refreshments : To reduce close contact between attendees at the physical AGM, no gift vouchers, food and beverages (other than bottled water) will be provided. Instead, to give back to the community, DBS will be donating the amount that was budgeted for these items to healthcare workers at the frontline of the fight against Covid-19. As part of DBS’ continued efforts to sustainability, all used plastic bottles at the event will be collected and recycled to ensure zero waste.

This marks Link’s first sustainability-linked loan following its issuance of USD 500 million green bonds in 2016 and HKD 4 billion convertible green bonds in 2019. To incentivise sustainable practices, DBS has structured the loan to incorporate a reduced pricing structure with interest cost savings. Link will be eligible for the interest savings if it maintains its listing on leading global sustainability indices and achieves sustainability milestones based on performance in the annual independently assessed Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). GRESB is widely recognised to be the leading sustainability benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. The proceeds of the loan will be used for general corporate funding purposes including sustainability initiatives. Subsequent to the acquisition of 100 Market Street in Sydney announced in December last year, Link is taking on the sustainability-linked loan in Australian dollar to match the currency of this investment. George Hongchoy, Link’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “As we pursue our medium-term goals outlined in Vision 2025 and to create value for our stakeholders and the communities we serve, we are pleased to ensure the integration of sustainability best practices into our daily operations by introducing our very first sustainability-linked loan with our key relationship bank, DBS.” Chew Chong Lim, Managing Director & Global Head of Real Estate, Institutional Banking, DBS, said, “DBS is privileged to partner Link as it progresses on its sustainability financing journey. As Asia’s largest REIT, Link’s maiden sustainability-linked loan underscores the growing shift towards responsible financing in the region. We believe financing solutions with features that incentivise sustainable development enable corporates to generate long-term value while contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We look forward to forging more such collaborations as we collectively meet tomorrow’s sustainability challenges.” Both Link and DBS are signatories to the United Nations Global Compact and are committed to driving progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in ways that are meaningful for their respective businesses. For DBS, this includes acting on climate change by partnering corporates in adopting responsible financing practices. In 2019, DBS provided sustainable financing amounting to about SGD 5 billion.

Given the rapidly-changing Covid-19 situation over the past week, we have decided to extend the enrolment deadline of this policy to 31 March 2020. This will give some of our customers, who have yet to sign up for themselves or their family members, more time to do so. Underwritten by Chubb Insurance, DBS’ regional general insurance partner, the 30-day free cover provides policyholders: A daily cash benefit for hospital confinement and a lump sum payout for ICU confinement, in relation to Covid-19. Worldwide coverage for policyholders who must travel during this period Coverage commences on the date of application and will expire automatically. Sign-ups are available online, or at any DBS/POSB branch islandwide. Said Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Head, “We would like to encourage all of our customers to apply for the free 30-day policy, which will provide them additional cash coverage that is on top of any existing policies they may already have. Alongside our collaboration with Chubb, we also worked with our regional life bancassurance partner Manulife to offer support in relation to Covid-19 for our customers who are also their existing policyholders. Through these two partnerships, we are able to provide our customers the most comprehensive Covid-19 relief insurance coverage currently available in Singapore.” DBS/POSB customers who are Singapore Residents aged 18 and above can apply for the COVID-19 Hospital Cash policy as the main policyholder, and include their immediate family members as additional insured persons. There is no age limit, though the policy can only insure those who are one month and above, and family members do not have to be DBS/POSB customers. Visit go.dbs.com/covid19 for more information. The bank has since introduced similar coverage policies for customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, also underwritten by Chubb Insurance, which were well-received.

Highlights of DBS 2019 Annual Report and Sustainability Report,09 Mar 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Highlights_of_DBS_2019_Annual_Report_and_Sustainability_Report," Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, China, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS today issued its 2019 Annual Report and second standalone Sustainability Report . The themes of both reports are ‘Pursuing the Greater Good’ and ‘Purpose-driven Bank’, respectively, reflecting DBS’ commitment to advancing the sustainability agenda as a purpose-driven bank. Key highlights for DBS in 2019 include: Being the first bank to hold three global best bank honours (by Euromoney, Global Finance and The Banker) at the same time. We were also recognised as being among the top 10 most successful business transformations of the decade by Harvard Business Review. The slew of global accolades continues to underscore our growing stature in the world (Page 3 of Annual Report) Being lauded by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for the strides we made in our digital transformation, and for our commitment to reskilling our workforce (Page 3 of Annual Report) Turning in record earnings and return on equity in 2019 of SGD 6.39 billion and 13.2%, respectively. Over the past 10 years, DBS’ total income has more than doubled, net profit has tripled, and market capitalisation has nearly doubled. Letter from Chairman and CEO  For an overview of our digital transformation and the progress we have made in our sustainability journey, please refer to the Letter from the Chairman and CEO on pages 8 to 11 in the Annual Report. CEO Reflections  Read about DBS CEO Piyush Gupta’s views on the role that businesses play in shaping a sustainable world, the impact of new digital entrants to the industry and the bank’s plans for Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, in pages 18-19 of the Annual Report. Digital transformation – Becoming a technology company 2019 marked the sixth year of our digital transformation journey – a journey we started in 2014, ahead of many of our peers. Our digital transformation has been focused on three areas – becoming digital to the core, embedding ourselves in the customer journey and becoming a 28,000-person startup. Today, we are in the unique position of being a technology company that does banking instead of a traditional bank looking to digitalise. In 2019, the proportion of digital customers in the Consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong rose to 52% from 48% in 2018, and reported income from the segment increased 16% year-on-year; income earned from an average digital customer continued to be twice that from a typical traditional customer with return on equity from the digital segment strengthening to 36% from 32% in 2018 (read more about our Digital Value Capture on page 22 of the CFO statement in the Annual Report) Key digital initiatives undertaken and progress made can be found in the Letter from Chairman and CEO (pages 8-11) and Chief Information Officer (CIO) statement (pages 36-37) Advancing our sustainability agenda We continue to advance our sustainability agenda through our three sustainability pillars of responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating social impact.

DBS accelerates trade digitalisation efforts with more ‘industry-firsts’ to drive greater efficiencies for customers,02 Mar 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_accelerates_trade_digitalisation_efforts_with_more_industry_firsts_to_drive_greater_efficiencies_for_customers, Singapore ,"- To drive greater efficiencies in trade, DBS Bank has closed another ‘industry-first’ with the completion of the first trade financing settlement through through vCargo Cloud’s CamelONE Trade Finance portal (TFP) – with another two transactions slated to close this week. The inaugural transaction relates to an SGD 4.8 million letter of credit [1] transaction by homegrown steel wholesaler and supplier, Super Steel Pte Ltd. As Singapore’s first unified multi-bank portal connected to the Networked Trade Platform (NTP) to aggregate trade financing products, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) like Super Steel are now able to conveniently apply for an array of trade finance solutions through the TFP. More importantly, by providing a standardised application form, the TFP eliminates the hassle of having to navigate through different banks’ sites, resulting in quicker application times and reduced human errors. This, in turn, helps enhance efficiency and productivity for both large corporates and SMEs seeking access to trade financing, and for banks to provide the service more efficiently. In addition, the information and data submitted for other trade purposes on the NTP, such as permit declaration, freight booking and cargo insurance can also be used to supplement corporates’ digital trade applications to banks – maximising digital data reuse. Sriram Muthukrishnan, Group Head of Trade Product Management, DBS Bank, said, “Trade finance is the lifeblood of commerce but can sometimes be quite manual and complex. By digitalising trade financing services via a one-stop portal, we are able to provide swift, easy and contact-free financing solutions to help our customers enjoy greater peace of mind when it comes to managing their banking needs. This is especially critical now as prolonged geopolitical tensions and trade frictions, along with Covid-19 concerns, have disrupted global and Asian supply chains, affecting the cash flows of many businesses in Singapore and the region.” As part of the bank’s efforts to digitalise trade across all fronts, DBS has also completed its first electronic banker’s guarantee [2] issuance on the newly-launched Singapore Customs Electronic Bank Guarantee Programme (eBG programme). The transaction relates to a SGD 49,000 transaction by leading automotive group, Komoco Holdings (Komoco). Launched today, the eBG programme was developed as part of efforts to enhance the banker’s guarantee lodgement process which tends to be highly manual and time intensive. For example, before the launch of the eBG programme, corporates will need to physically deliver the original hard copy of the banker’s guarantee to the Singapore Customs (Customs). But today, DBS is now able to help our corporate customers send their banker’s guarantee directly to the Customs, and concurrently digitally share data from the banker’s guarantee in real-time through the NTP. This helps cut short the banker’s guarantee issuance and submission process to the Customs from an average of three to four working days, to less than 24 hours. Accelerating trade digitalisation across multiple fronts Apart from driving trade digitalisation efforts externally, DBS has also looked within the bank to provide inhouse solutions to enhance support for its corporate customers. As part of broader relief measures, DBS has recently launched the service where all corporate customers can now upload their supporting trade documents onto the bank’s corporate banking platform, DBS IDEAL. This means that customers will be able to submit trade financing applications online, as well as digitally upload and reload any required documents such as trade contracts, invoices, customs declarations and purchase orders. These applications were previously mainly done physically at trade counters or at bank branches. Customers will also be able to get instant notifications of their application status through email and SMS.

[2] A banker’s guarantee is a guarantee from a bank, usually issued on behalf of a company, and represents the bank’s irrevocable obligation to make payment, when a claim is made by the beneficiary named in the guarantee. The bank will only ensure that the claim complies with the guarantee terms before it makes payment. A claim is normally triggered by the beneficiary when the company fails in its performance under the contract for which the banker’s guarantee is issued.

DBS implements first-in-Asia portfolio advisory tool for wealth clients,27 Feb 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_implements_first_in_Asia_portfolio_advisory_tool_for_wealth_clients, Singapore ,"- DBS Private Bank (PB) and Treasures Private Client (TPC) clients can now expect even more insightful and comprehensive client investment reviews going forward with the launch of the DBS Portfolio Advisory Enablement Tool (PAET). The first-of-its-kind in Asia, PAET is a state-of-the-art analysis tool that can swiftly perform in-depth assessments of a client’s portfolio performance and risk exposures, to ultimately produce richer insights focused on clients’ needs: it can benchmark the client’s investments against his/her risk appetite and aims, provide portfolio and market performance, and show full risk exposures and asset allocation. With PAET, which has been progressively implemented across DBS PB and TPC since late 2019, DBS’ relationship managers (RMs) can now quickly analyse their clients’ investments to offer even more personalised and relevant investment recommendations. Traditional client investment reviews – where RMs and their clients examine investment performance and refine strategies – often involve the use of client statements. The typical client statement provides a list of the client’s investments, with each investment presented as a single-line item stating its performance. This format leaves out valuable contextual information (i.e. how each investment’s performance fares in contrast to the wider portfolio or equivalent benchmarks, and where the overall portfolio risk exposures lie) and does not provide a complete picture of the portfolio. Co-developed by DBS and wealth technology provider EdgeLab, PAET addresses this gap by running a portfolio-wide “health check” – assessing all investment holdings in the client’s portfolio to understand its overall performance, risk exposures and potential opportunities. It can: • Risk-dissect all the client’s investment holdings, which may include a mix of asset types [1] , and consolidate each holding’s risk exposure to provide a full view of the client’s portfolio risk • Measure and analyse the performance of all the client’s investment holdings, both as individual holdings and collectively as a portfolio, and identify key performance drivers • Provide estimated future cashflow projections for fixed income assets The additional information allows RMs and clients to consider portfolio risks and returns in their entirety, so RMs can provide more contextualised and holistic advice for new investment opportunities. A PAET report can be generated in less than five minutes, using just one-fifth of the time it takes to compile an equivalent report manually – improving RM productivity while eliminating the possibility for human error. The integration of PAET into DBS’ systems also speaks to the bank’s world-leading technological capabilities – across the front, middle and back-end. In implementing PAET, DBS deployed a mix of public and private cloud solutions to ensure scalability that can match demand and support usage across multiple customer channels. The bank is now moving on to phase two of PAET development, to further enhance quality of advice and client engagement. It will equip RMs with the ability to simulate investments into existing portfolios so clients can view their potential value-add, as well as propose and construct new client portfolios. Said Sim S Lim, Group Head of Consumer Banking and Wealth Management, DBS Bank, “Understanding what you own and how each investment impacts your portfolio is fundamental to making robust investment decisions. It is key to navigating today’s uncertain markets, where it is important to go back to basics, and not leave things to luck or chance. PAET allows us to efficiently deliver the insights RMs and clients need to make informed decisions based on real risks and performance drivers. It is testament to our capabilities in harnessing technology to transform the ‘usual way’ of doing things, empowering our RMs to provide richer, more detailed and contextualised investment advice that benefits clients for the long-term.” PAET-generated reports will be provided as supplements to monthly client statements. All DBS PB and TPC RMs have undergone in-depth training to be able to fully harness insights from these reports, to ensure that conversations with clients become even more focused and productive. The PAET solution speaks to DBS’ commitment to empowering clients with tailored insights for more informed decision-making in today’s increasingly volatile world. In January, the bank announced the adoption of MSCI ESG Ratings for its wealth management business, aimed at providing greater transparency and enabling clients to assess the environmental, social and governance (ESG) characteristics of their investment portfolios.

"DBS rolls out digital solutions to give businesses ""Contact-free"" banking options for greater peace of mind during Covid-19",26 Feb 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_rolls_out_digital_solutions_to_give_businesses_Contact_free_banking_options_for_greater_peace_of_mind_during_Covid_19, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced its second round of relief measures to help businesses in Singapore cope better with the COVID-19 situation. These measures are a mix of financial relief packages and a slew of digital initiatives to enable companies to fast track their digital adoption and transaction fulfilment needs in the face of business continuity measures currently adopted by most companies. The latest relief measures are: • Collateral-free Digital Business Loan of up to SGD50,000, disbursed within 24 hours of loan acceptance • Digitalisation of 11 common trade financing [1] processes to reduce the need to be reliant on physical over-the-counter trade processing • 50 free FAST transactions a month to promote reduced physical handling of cheques (up from 30 free FAST transactions a month) • Webinars and customised teach-ins to train customers on how to use and benefit from the convenience that our new digital capabilities afford • Digitalisation of the bank’s popular DBS SME Academy’s training courses so that upskilling and learning can still continue in the safety of customers’ homes and offices Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Institutional Banking, DBS said that the latest measures are aimed at helping SMEs and corporates facing the challenging reality of the COVID-19 situation. This includes disrupted supply chains, falling customer demand, cash flow issues and difficulties in fulfilling transactions with physical documents. “Both the short-term financing relief packages and the longer-term digital adoption plans that are being made available to clients now will help businesses with their immediate cash flow needs and their longer term digital transformation efforts which should continue even in the face of economic headwinds,” Tan added. Collateral-free Digital Business Loan of up to SGD50,000 in 24 hours From today onwards, existing SME customers can apply for a short-term collateral-free loan of up to SGD50,000 and upon approval of the loan, can look forward to receiving their funds in 24 hours. The collateral-free loan will also come with an automatic processing fee waiver. This comes on the back of a dipstick poll of about 100 SME clients in Singapore to ascertain their top financial concerns and challenges while navigating the COVID-19 situation. The poll which was conducted in early February revealed that seven in 10 SMEs’ top concern during this period was ensuring consistent cashflow for ongoing operational costs. DBS – first Singapore bank to introduce comprehensive digital “contact-free” trade financing digital capabilities To minimise the need for couriers and clients’ employees to physically submit paper-based applications at trade counters, DBS will be the first Singapore bank to introduce a comprehensive suite of “contact-free” trade financing digital solutions, eliminating the need for the manual processing of trade financing solutions. Customers can now access a one-stop portal through DBS’ Corporate Banking platform IDEAL to upload all their trade financing applications and supporting documents. This will apply immediately to 11 everyday trade financing solutions such as letters of credit, import bills, trust receipts, banker’s guarantees and shipping guarantees. This means that customers will be able to submit trade financing applications online, as well as digitally upload and reload any required documents such as trade contracts, invoices, customs declarations and purchase orders. These applications were previously mainly done physically at trade counters or at bank branches. They will also be able to get instant notifications of their application status through email and SMS. With trade financing solutions digitalised, clients will also be able to retrieve their historical supporting documents online and submit their documentation and applications round the clock instead of relying on the DBS trade counters [2] and branch banking operating hours. To help clients get familiarised with these and other new digital features, from 2 March onwards, the bank will also be progressively rolling out webinars and customised “teach-in” sessions for them. These digital solutions were already part of DBS’ roadmap to partner clients in their drive for digital transformation, but were accelerated and made available in Singapore and DBS’ key markets of Mainland China and Hong Kong to support clients with their continued business operations during the COVID-19 situation. Promoting lifelong learning and upskilling Even as businesses hunker down during this period of uncertainty, DBS is ensuring that the government’s SkillsFuture movement to promote lifelong learning and upskilling continues. It will do this by moving its popular SME Academy training courses online, enabling SME owners and employees to continue to upskill themselves in the safety of their homes and offices. In addition, DBS BusinessClass [3] will continue to roll out relevant bite-sized business content through its online and social medial channels. Businesses can access a range of training courses from cash management to accounting to brand management and marketing at www.dbs.com.sg/sme/businessclass/sme-online-academy.page “In these difficult times, technology plays a key role in empowering “contact-free” banking and also ensuring that life goes on with as little disruption as possible. As the world’s best digital bank, we believe it is important to harness our digital capabilities and technological know-how to deliver enhanced digital banking services to our clients. This way, they can continue to run their business smoothly while safeguarding their health and well-being at the same time,” Tan said. The latest round of COVID-19 relief measures are on the back of DBS’ first set of relief measures for corporate clients announced on 13 February which included a six-month principal repayment moratorium for SME property loans.

Gains on investment securities more than doubled to SGD 334 million. The increases in both trading income and gains on investment securities were also due to a low year-ago base. They combined to more than offset the impact of a SGD 91 million property gain the year before. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management (CBG/WM) income rose 11% to SGD 6.30 billion led by deposit and investment product income. Institutional Banking (IBG) income grew 5% to SGD 6.07 billion from higher cash management, loans and investment banking income. Treasury Markets income increased 39% to SGD 932 million as the unit benefitted from more conducive market conditions than the previous year. Expenses were 8% higher at SGD 6.26 billion. The positive jaw of two percentage points led to a one-percentage-point improvement in the cost-income ratio to 43%, reflecting gains in operating efficiency as well as the strong growth in other non-interest income. Profit before allowances increased 12% to SGD 8.29 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings up 14% from year ago For the fourth quarter, net profit rose 14% from a year ago to SGD 1.51 billion on the back of broad-based business momentum. Net interest income rose 4% to SGD 2.43 billion as loans grew 4% to SGD 358 billion. Net interest margin was little changed at 1.86%. Fee income increased 17% to SGD 741 million, led by a 31% increase in wealth management fees due to buoyant investor sentiment, in contrast to the equity market sell-off the year before. A significant number of transactions led to a near tripling of investment banking fees. Other non-interest income rose 5% to SGD 294 million from higher gains on investment securities. Trading income was stable. Expenses increased 7%, in line with income growth, to SGD 1.60 billion. Profit before allowances grew 7% to SGD 1.86 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings 7% below previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, fourth-quarter net profit was 7% lower. Total income fell 9% to SGD 3.46 billion due to seasonally lower non-interest income and a decline in net interest margin from falling interest rates. Net interest income declined 1%. Loans expanded 2% led by trade loans and non-trade corporate loans. Consumer loans also grew with housing loans rising moderately after three consecutive quarters of decline. The increase in loan volumes was offset by a four-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 1.86% due to lower interest rates. Fee income fell 9% from a seasonal decline in wealth management fees and from lower loan-related fees. The declines were moderated by higher fees from investment banking and transaction services. Other non-interest income was 46% lower as quieter markets at year-end resulted in a halving of trading income and gains on investment securities. Expenses declined 1% while profit before allowances was 16% lower. Balance sheet remains strong Compared to the previous quarter, non-performing assets (NPA) fell 3% to SGD 5.77 billion as new NPA formation was more than offset by write-offs and recoveries. The majority of the new NPA formation was from exposures that were fully secured. The NPL rate was unchanged at 1.5%. Fourth-quarter specific allowances were SGD 199 million, or 21 basis points of loans, in line with recent quarterly trends. There was a general allowance write-back of SGD 77 million, which was reclassified as specific allowances for new NPA. Allowance coverage was at 94% and at 191% after taking collateral into account. Deposits rose 2% from the previous quarter and 3% from a year ago in constant-currency terms, in line with loan growth, to SGD 404 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio of 139% and the net stable funding ratio of 110% were both above the regulatory requirement of 100%. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio increased 0.3 percentage points from the previous quarter to 14.1% due mainly to net profit accretion. The leverage ratio of 7.0% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%. The Board proposed a final dividend of 33 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend will be $1.32 per share, an increase of 10%. The higher quarterly dividend is in line with the policy of paying sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “Our record performance with return on equity at a new high of 13.2% demonstrates a franchise that delivers high quality results. The increased quarterly dividend proposed by the Board reflects the enhanced capacity of our business to generate earnings and reward shareholders.” [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS to offer broad range of COVID-19 liquidity relief measures for SME and retail clients,13 Feb 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_offer_broad_range_of_COVID_19_liquidity_relief_measures_for_SME_and_retail_clients, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced that it will introduce a range of liquidity relief measures and other initiatives to help businesses, retail customers and communities impacted by the COVID-19 situation. Liquidity relief package for SMEs and retail customers In early February, DBS conducted a dipstick poll of about 100 SME clients to ascertain their top financial concerns and challenges at this time. The poll revealed that SMEs’ top concern during this period was ensuring consistent cashflow for ongoing operating costs. To address these concerns, DBS will provide liquidity relief packages to address their most urgent cashflow needs. In particular, the bank will provide a six-month principal repayment moratorium for SME property loans. It will also offer an extension of import facilities of up to 60 days to act as immediate cashflow support for businesses coping with disruptions from the coronavirus situation. These initiatives will be available upon application to customers with good repayment histories. Similarly, affected retail customers with good repayment histories can apply for a six-month principal repayment moratorium for mortgage loans. Further details will be shared on DBS/POSB’s website from 17 February onwards. Support for Singaporeans’ education and transport needs To help Singaporeans navigate these challenging times, the bank is also working with partners to provide them with subsidised or complimentary services: DBS has partnered with 88Tuition to offer unlimited free online supplementary lessons for primary and secondary school students from 17 February till 30 April 2020. This will give those with children added peace of mind, as their children can continue to have access to classes, while minimising physical contact with others. Further details will be shared on DBS/POSB’s website from 17 February onwards DBS is partnering ComfortDelGro in its initiative to encourage commuters to use the bank’s debit or credit cards for street hail fares, which will also help in contact tracing Support and care for the healthcare community   To show solidarity and support to healthcare workers and the broader frontline community, the bank will also work with community partners to provide them with tokens of appreciation, such as care packages and F&B treats. More details on the support and care packages for healthcare and frontline workers will be announced soon. Said DBS Singapore Country Head Shee Tse Koon: “In these difficult times, we feel it is incumbent upon us as Singapore’s largest bank to lend a helping hand to our clients and the public-at-large. We hope the liquidity measures will go some way in easing the financial pressure that some individuals and SMEs may face. Other initiatives are intended to help customers adjust to the little changes they may have to make in daily living. Overall, we hope that these small gestures will go a long way in encouraging the community to press on.” For more information on DBS’ latest COVID-19 relief measures, SMEs can call the dedicated DBS SME Banking BusinessCare team at 1800 222 2200.

DBS makes steady headway in digitalising trade; completes first fully digital trade financing settlement on Singapore’s networked trade platform with Audi Singapore and Premium Automobiles,06 Feb 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_makes_steady_headway_in_digitalising_trade_completes_first_fully_digital_trade_financing_settlement_on_Singapores_networked_trade_platform_with_Audi_Singapore_and_Premium_Automobiles, Singapore ,"- Advancing Singapore’s trade digitalisation agenda, DBS Bank, in collaboration with Audi Singapore (Audi) and Audi’s local distributor, Premium Automobiles (Premium), completed the first trade financing transaction on Singapore’s Networked Trade Platform [1] (NTP). The inaugural trade relates to a SGD3.5 million letter of credit [2] transaction for a trade of Audi cars between Audi and Premium. In the traditional world of trade, car importers, such as Audi, have to physically present an array of paper-based trade documents to complete a letter of credit transaction. However, by digitalising the process through the NTP, Audi and their retail partner Premium, are now able to submit bank applications, as well as send and receive trade documents online. In turn, this enables DBS to receive and start processing the e-applications in real-time, cutting short the trade financing processing time from about a week to under one working day, yielding greater operational efficiencies for both buyer and seller. In addition, as trade documents are uploaded onto the NTP, all trade participants are able to enjoy real-time updates on the progress of their transaction, enabling them to better plan their working capital needs. Sriram Muthukrishnan, Group Head of Trade Product Management, DBS Bank, said, “Technology continues to fundamentally reshape the world of trade and finance. With digitalisation, trade information is increasingly democratised and interoperability between trade platforms is enhanced, enabling companies around the world to trade more efficiently and seamlessly with each other. The NTP is a landmark initiative that enables disparate client activities to come together in a secure and efficient digital environment. As a bank, we continue to be passionate about ensuring our corporate clients are well-equipped to ride the wave of digital trade innovation globally.” Markus Schuster, Managing Director, Audi Singapore, said, “Audi is a progressive company and we believe that we should utilise all the advantages of the connected world. We engineer digital solutions in our cars, our mobility services and in all areas of our business process. We look for ways to do things better; with better security, greater accuracy, more efficiencies and greater benefits to our customers and partners. That’s why we are keen to use the platform.” Lee Hoe Lone, Managing Director, Premium Automobiles, said, “We are very pleased to be part of this digital initiative. As the exclusive retail partner of Audi cars in Singapore, Premium Automobiles is constantly pushing forth digitalisation of business processes. This initiative aligns with the bigger objective of our company’s initiatives in achieving business efficacy and efficiencies.” Serene Ho, Director of Networked Trade Platform Office (NTPO), said, “Digitalising a traditionally paper-centric trade ecosystem requires support from like-minded industry partners who embrace technology and change. NTPO congratulates DBS Bank, Audi Singapore and Premium Automobiles on completing its first trade finance transaction on NTP. NTP will continue to work with financial institutions and industry partners to realise Singapore’s vision of a paperless trade ecosystem.” The first transaction marks a critical step towards transforming documentary trade, of which domestic letters of credit constitute around USD150 billion [3] of Singapore’s trade flows. DBS, Audi and Premium are currently working on the second trade on the NTP valued at SGD2.8 million. DBS is also one of the key banks leading the Trade Finance Compliance (TFC) initiative, which is a digital service on the NTP to boost trade security in Singapore. Launched in September 2019, the TFC service aims to tackle trade finance compliance challenges by addressing obstacles faced by financial institutions when financing trade in Asia, such as trade fraud risks and the lack of reliable data to conduct price checks for non-commoditised goods – which often do not have established pricing benchmarks. DBS is also one of the nine leading banks on CamelONE Trade Finance™, a NTP-integrated multi-bank trade finance application portal that simplifies the application for trade financing through the use of a standard application form across multiple banks. Committed to developing digital trade ecosystems and platforms Since 2018, DBS has launched several ecosystems and platforms to encourage companies to move towards digital trade. To find out more, please click on the following links: • DBS and Trafigura collaborate with IMDA to launch open-sourced blockchain trade platform • HeveaConnect - a digital trading marketplace for sustainable rubber • Agrocorp - a digital trade platform for commoditie s • Wanxiang - a digital trade platform for automotive supply chain [1] The NTP is a national trade information management platform that provides the foundation for Singapore to be the world's leading trade, supply chain and trade financing hub. The platform forms part of a wider concerted effort to drive an industry-wide digital transformation to build a trade and logistics digital ecosystem which connects businesses, community systems and platforms and government systems.

DBS makes Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for third year running,21 Jan 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_makes_Bloomberg_Gender_Equality_Index_GEI_for_third_year_running," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank has been named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the third year running. DBS’ inclusion in this year’s index recognises the bank’s commitment to workplace gender equality. This includes having a robust female leadership and talent pipeline, gender pay parity, and an inclusive culture. Apart from its policies, the bank has also demonstrated its strong support for gender equality through its disclosure practices and transparency. Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “The diversity of our people is a powerful performance lever. In a world where women continue to be underrepresented, we have been focused on building a respectful and inclusive workplace that provides equal opportunity and growth.

DBS launches industry-first solution to transform B2B payments and collections landscape in Singapore,20 Jan 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_industry_first_solution_to_transform_B2B_payments_and_collections_landscape_in_Singapore, Singapore ,"- Paying suppliers and vendors with cash could soon be a thing of the past for Singapore’s 28,000 coffee shops, hawker centres and restaurants [1] . DBS has launched an industry-first solution to transform the largely cash and paper-based B2B payments and collections landscape for businesses in Singapore. DBS’ QR-code based solution is powered by DBS RAPID [2] and DBS MAX [3] and addresses Singapore’s aim of enhancing productivity by eliminating cheques by 2025 and going cashless. (From left to right) SG5 Chairman Lee Hong Kiat, DBS’ Group Head of SME Banking Joyce Tee, Huber’s Butchery’s Executive Director Andre Huber and SG5 CEO Alvin Chua. The B2B payments and collections solution was developed after close to 20 digital workshops with F&B operators to map their payments journey and pain points. The workshops which were run by DBS also uncovered that on average, close to nine in 10 B2B payments in the F&B industry are still cash-based or done through bank transfers. The new solution which facilitates cashless and faster F&B payments is an end-to-end QR collection enabled platform that enables instant payments with automated accounts reconciliation functionalities in the backend. Unlike other solutions in the market, customers can also consolidate multiple invoices into one QR-code based transaction. They also have the flexibility to make full or partial payments for one or multiple invoices, and in turn suppliers now have the option of enhancing credit terms for each invoice instantly. To bring customers greater convenience, suppliers can also send a QR code requesting for payment to their customers who are not on-hand to receive the goods in-person. DBS’ new payment solution allows businesses such as Huber’s Butchery to make QR payments easily SG5, the main distributor for Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore, is one of the first F&B operators to pilot the solution. The company, a wholesale distributor of beer and stout supplies about 5,600 F&B retailers from coffee shops to large chains such as Huber’s Butchery. Through this solution, SG5 believes the company will save up to 3,300 manhours a month. Digitalising payments for F&B players is the first step in transforming the cash-intensive B2B payments and collections landscape, said Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank. “Many SMEs we speak to want to realise productivity gains by becoming more digital but they don’t have the expertise or infrastructure to do so. By understanding their pain points and then laying the foundation for enhanced payments capabilities one sector at a time, DBS aims to lead the way in digitalising and streamlining the payments landscape in Singapore. Our aim is to enable our SMEs’ time-strapped workforce to be able to spend more time serving their customers and exploring new business opportunities.” SG5 CEO Alvin Chua is looking forward to utilising the 3,300 manhours saved on accounting and administrative tasks every month. “On average, our frontline staff spend around 3.5 hours every day traveling to different parts of the island to collect cash and cheque payments. With the new payments solution and precious man-hours saved, I hope to be able to upskill my staff so that we can work together to bring the business to new heights. It will also be a boon to our cashflow as we will be able to receive payments instantly upon delivery of goods.” Andre Huber (right), Executive Director of Huber’s Butchery, using DBS’ new QR payment solution to pay for APB goods from SG5 Huber’s Butchery is a family-run business specialising in manufacturing and processing gourmet meat products for hotels, restaurants, marine and aircraft suppliers and caterers. In addition, it also has a consumer-facing retail shop and bistro. Together with SG5, Huber’s is one of the first F&B retailers to adopt the solution. “Consumers today are digitally-savvy and we have equipped our frontline staff with digital payments systems. Similarly, our business partners are learning to harness technology for greater efficiencies so that as an industry, we can all experience greater productivity. We are excited to work with DBS and SG5 on this new payment solution. It’ll definitely allow our employees to spend more time delighting our customers,” said Andre Huber, Executive Director of Huber’s Butchery.

DBS delivers greater convenience this CNY with revamped DBS QR gift,10 Jan 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_delivers_greater_convenience_this_CNY_with_revamped_DBS_QR_gift, Singapore ,"- Following last year’s launch of the DBS QR Gift (then introduced as DBS QR Ang Bao), the world’s first loadable QR solution, DBS is back this Chinese New Year (CNY) with an enhanced version, boasting new features that deliver greater convenience and ease of use to customers. First piloted during CNY 2019, DBS’ pioneering solution enabled users to ‘load’ desired cash values onto unique QR codes via DBS PayLah!, one of Singapore’s most popular mobile payment platforms with some 1.6 million users. With the dual objective of eliminating the use of cash whilst preserving the tradition of exchanging physical red packets, the DBS QR Gift was well received by the public, with over SGD 1.5 million loaded onto DBS QR Gift cards during the CNY 2019 period. The acceptance of digital alternatives for gifting is also reflected in the growing use of DBS PayLah!’s eGifts (previously known as eAng Baos). eGift usage has been rising steadily year-on-year since they were first introduced in 2015 – the total number of eGifts sent during CNY 2019 was almost double that of CNY 2018. CNY 2019 also saw double the average number of eGifts sent per day as compared to CNY 2018. Enhanced DBS QR Gift with new features To deliver greater convenience, time savings and festive cheer to consumers this CNY, DBS is rolling out a suite of new features for the DBS QR Gift: 1) DBS PayLah! for teenagers : Teenagers can now access DBS PayLah! with their parents’ consent (the service was previously open only to those aged 16 years and above). This allows youths to redeem DBS QR Gift cards on their own, saving parents the hassle of doing so on their behalf. 2) Open to all PayNow users : Previously exclusive to DBS PayLah!, DBS QR Gift cards can now be redeemed by both DBS PayLah! and PayNow users. All Singapore bank account holders with SingPass and a PayNow-linked bank account can now conveniently scan and redeem funds from DBS QR Gift cards and have the loaded value credited directly into their accounts. 3) Bulk-loading : The new bulk-loading feature enables customers to save time by loading up to 10 DBS QR Gift cards at once, instead of having to scan and load each at a time. The 10 DBS QR Gift cards will feature the same loaded cash value, message and animation. 4) New design : The DBS QR Gift is made of environmentally-friendly paper and designed so they can be given out without the use of red packets, with space for users to pen personalised messages for their recipients. Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank said, “We’re pleased that the public responded warmly to the DBS QR Gift last year and have been taking in feedback from consumers since then. Mindful that convenience and ease of use remain key for users, given how hectic preparing for CNY can be, we have since enhanced the DBS QR Gift by introducing bulk-loading features and making it accessible to more users. We hope this will make CNY celebrations more seamless and hassle-free for consumers, giving them more quality time with family and friends.” DBS QR Gift cards come in packs of eight and are now available for free at all DBS/POSB full-service branches, DBS Treasures Centres and POSB Pop-up ATMs located island-wide. The DBS QR Gift cards will be valid for use from 9 January 2020 to 21 February 2020; funds not redeemed by 21 February 2020 will be refunded to the givers. Businesses pledging to use DBS QR Gift in CNY 2020 According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, up to 40 million of the slightly more than 100 million notes printed for CNY each year end up being incinerated [1] . DBS has also built an in-house carbon calculator, which estimates that if all DBS customers reduced their cash withdrawal by 1%, the total carbon emissions saved would be equivalent to almost 600 trees. By doing away with the need for cash, DBS QR Gift aims to lessen wastage caused by the printing of new notes and presents a more sustainable option to gifting. DBS is actively extending the use of DBS QR Gift cards to corporate partners, with SMRT Corporation, Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited, Manulife, Tribal Worldwide Singapore and VICOM – who collectively have some 14,000 employees – pledging to adopt it for employee gifting this CNY, replacing traditional physical red packets and new notes. “Real change takes a collective effort – one that requires individuals, organisations and nations to play their part. We are committed to our sustainability journey at DBS, and have been looking to leverage digital technology and innovation to achieve greater progress on this front. We are heartened to have these companies’ support in our shift towards using digital alternatives for festive gifting, and to join us in building a more sustainable Singapore,” said Soo. Recycle used red packets and DBS QR Gifts at DBS/POSB branches DBS will also be bringing back its red packet recycling bins, which were first introduced during CNY 2019. Starting 28 January 2020, the recycling bins will be available at all DBS/POSB full-service branches all year round. Customers are encouraged to play a part in reducing waste by dropping off their used red packets and DBS QR Gifts in these bins. DBS was the first bank in Singapore to launch a dedicated recycling movement for red packets and is partnering Tay Paper Recycling for this initiative. Win up to SGD 888 in the DBS TapLah! Contest DBS will be rolling out “TapLah!”, a mobile game hosted on DBS PayLah!. Players are required to collect as many gold coins (+3 points) and red packets (+25 points) as possible within 30 seconds, whilst avoiding the bombs (-10 points). Top players’ points will be listed and ranked on a public scoreboard. The game will be live on the DBS PayLah! app from 25 January to 8 February 2020 (“game period”).

DBS furthers sustainability agenda with MSCI ESG Ratings,03 Jan 2020,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_furthers_sustainability_agenda_with_MSCI_ESG_Ratings, Singapore ,"- DBS has adopted MSCI ESG Ratings for its wealth management business, with the aim of providing clients with greater transparency over the environmental, social and governance (ESG) characteristics of their investment portfolios. This comes amidst growing interest in ESG investing (defined as the consideration of ESG factors alongside financial factors in the investment decision-making process) and aligns with the bank’s commitment to enhancing clients’ understanding on this front. MSCI ESG Ratings score companies on their ESG risk exposure and risk management abilities relative to industry peers. Apart from identifying ESG risks and opportunities within investment portfolios, the ratings also serve as an additional tool for investment analysis – allowing investors to go beyond conventional financial analyses when assessing how their investments measure up to others, and therefore make more informed investment decisions. DBS has adopted MSCI ESG Ratings (which covers equities, bonds and funds) as of November 2019, which will be embedded in DBS’ suite of wealth products, advisory and discretionary portfolio services. The ratings will be availed to wealth clients through their relationship managers upon request. DBS will also explore leveraging this capability to introduce ESG offerings in retail applications. Though relatively nascent in Asia, ESG investing is a growing trend that cannot be ignored. According to the CFA Institute, ESG assets under management in Asia have been the fastest-growing since 2014 [1] . This momentum is set to continue, driven in part by the impending intergenerational transfer of wealth to sustainability-conscious millennial investors – a 2017 FactSet study found that 90% of the high net worth millennials surveyed want to increase their allocations to responsible investments within five years [2] . Said Marc Lansonneur, Head of Managed Solutions, Balance Sheet Products and Investment Governance at DBS Wealth, “Clients’ attitudes towards ESG investing are becoming increasingly favourable. Encouraged by growing evidence of the correlation between robust ESG practices and strong corporate financial performance, more are expressing interest in incorporating ESG into their decision-making processes. However, they are often hampered by the lack of historical ESG data or a recognised sustainability benchmark. By adopting MSCI ESG Ratings and enabling transparent comparability, we hope to address this gap and drive growth in the ESG investing space.” Lim Beng Eu, Head of South East Asia Client Coverage at MSCI said, “MSCI ESG Research is extremely pleased to be working with DBS Bank in their effort to provide their wealth clients with greater transparency on ESG issues. MSCI ESG Research is committed to providing ESG analytic tools and research insights to help investors to better understand and plan for portfolio risks and to make better informed investment decisions.” This initiative is the latest of DBS’ efforts to provide clients with ease of access to ESG investing. The bank believes a properly structured ESG portfolio allows investors to align investments with personal values and reap the benefits of both, and has introduced a suite of ESG offerings – these include the DBS ESG MSCI Asia outperformance structured note and warrant, which were built on the investment thesis that investing based on ESG principles improves the risk-return characteristics of a portfolio; the inaugural issuance of Women’s Livelihood Bond, the world’s first social sustainability bond listed on a stock exchange; as well as a highly selective programme of ESG funds, chosen for their sustainable competitive advantages that make them more likely to outperform their given benchmarks in the long-term.

DBS/POSB boosts staff training to raise dementia awareness,26 Dec 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBSPOSB_boosts_staff_training_to_raise_dementia_awareness, Singapore ,"- To help raise awareness for a dementia-friendly Singapore, DBS/POSB has rolled out Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) Dementia Awareness (Foundation) e-learning course to all 12,000 staff in Singapore via the bank’s cloud-based learning platform. The course aims to equip staff with the skills to recognise signs of dementia in customers, identify ways to reduce the risk of dementia, and learn how to communicate with people with signs of dementia. Since its launch last week, 90% of all customer-facing DBS/POSB branch staff have completed the e-learning course and can help notice warning signs to protect customers with dementia from potential issues such as financial neglect and exploitation. “With Singapore being one of the fastest-ageing countries in the world, we recognise that it is our shared social responsibility to support our seniors by ensuring our staff understand how to handle age-related health issues, such as dementia, and in turn develop greater empathy for those affected,” said Yeo Wenxian, Head of DBS & POSB Branch Banking. “At DBS/POSB, we believe in creating a positive impact beyond banking. By providing learning tools to all staff to educate them on our wider social issues, we hope to create a more supportive and empathetic culture in Singapore – a culture that is well-equipped to take care of the needs of our seniors.” Many have found the Dementia Awareness (Foundation) course and its annual refresher informative and timely. Kina Neo, Branch Service Manager at DBS South Bridge branch, has been putting the skills into practice, with positive outcomes. “As dementia does not only affect the elderly, learning how to spot dementia symptoms has proved to be a useful skill, especially among younger customers where signs may not be immediately obvious. I’ve also found the course’s guidance quite insightful, such as showing greater empathy when communicating with customers who may have dementia by engaging them in casual conversation and speaking to them slowly and clearly,” she said. Promoting active ageing The e-learning course adds to ongoing bank initiatives that aim to support Singapore’s ageing population and the growing number of people diagnosed with dementia in Singapore, which is estimated to affect 103,000 people by 2030 [1] . Since 2016, DBS/POSB’s frontline staff have been attending training workshops by speakers from the “Forget Us Not” initiative [2] to gain a deeper understanding on how to communicate with persons showing signs of dementia. The bank also organises mental wellness advocacy programmes at community centres across Singapore to raise dementia awareness and provide prevention tips for seniors. In addition, DBS/POSB regularly reaches out to seniors in the community to educate them on financial literacy, self-service banking, digital skills and active ageing. In the region, over a third of Asia’s population is expected to be over the age of 60 by 2050, making Asia home to the world’s largest ageing population[3]. To raise awareness on active ageing, DBS has launched season two, episode six of its award-winning miniseries DBS Sparks. The episode is inspired by LongGood, a Taiwanese healthtech social start-up supported by the DBS Foundation. Using motion-sensing technology, cloud capabilities and gamification design, LongGood has developed rehabilitation training programmes and physical fitness assessment tools that allow patients to be treated with high quality rehab service anytime, anywhere.

Both DUO Tower and DUO Galleria have held the Green Mark Platinum Certification awarded by the Singapore Building and Construction Authority since 2013. This is in recognition of the mixed-office and retail development’s green features, such as the double-glazed low-emissivity glass exterior [2] , rainwater harvesting system and surrounding lush green landscape. The three banks acted as green loan advisers, joint mandated lead arrangers, underwriters and bookrunners to Ophir-Rochor Commercial Pte. Ltd., the joint venture between Allianz Real Estate – acting on behalf of several Allianz group companies – and Gaw Capital Partners. UOB also acted as the facility and security agent to the syndicated green loan. Ms Lim Lay Wah, UOB’s Global Head of Financial Institutions Group (Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Global Property Funds and Financial Sponsors), said, “As part of contributing to the community’s long-term economic, social and environmental well-being, UOB is committed to securing more green business opportunities together with our clients. The real estate sector has been leading the charge in the demand for green financing, with more property owners, managers and financial sponsors upholding sustainability standards as part of their climate action efforts. The green loan to Allianz Real Estate and Gaw Capital exemplifies our collaborative approach with our clients to fund projects that are environmentally friendly and promote sustainability.” Mr Chew Chong Lim, Managing Director and Global Head of Real Estate, Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank, said, “Responsible banking is one of the key tenets of our sustainability agenda and financing green infrastructure is an important way to encourage a tangible shift towards a low carbon economy. We are encouraged by the steady traction in green and sustainability-linked loans from the real estate industry, and continue to seek meaningful partnerships with like-minded players to advance the collective ambition to build towards a more sustainable future.” Mr Patrick Lee, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Bank Singapore, said, “Standard Chartered Bank is committed to growing its sustainable finance portfolio in Singapore so that it can play a role in directing capital to build a more green and sustainable environment. Singapore is fast becoming a hub for green and sustainable loan issuances with over US$6 billion of loan issuances between 2018 and October 2019. We are keen to do more and will seek opportunities to work with our partners like Allianz Real Estate and Gaw Capital Partners who are exhibiting leadership in making a social and environmental impact and raising the bar for green financing in Singapore.” Mr Rushabh Desai, CEO of Allianz Real Estate Asia Pacific, said, “Sustainable factors have a strong influence on the way that Allianz Real Estate acquires and manages its buildings and we have recently joined a number of initiatives that consider investments with a sustainable approach while seeking to improve social well-being. Through green loans, we find yet another path to investing responsibly while strengthening our relationships with like-minded business partners.” Ms Christina Gaw, Managing Principal and Head of Capital Markets for Gaw Capital Partners, said, “Gaw Capital Partners is keen to integrate ESG considerations into every part of our business. This green loan reflects our commitment in finding ways to finance and to operate a more sustainable business. We are also excited to support the development of sustainable capital markets globally.” The green loan was structured in accordance with Ophir-Rochor Commercial’s green loan framework, which is aligned with the Green Loan Principles issued by the Loan Market Association in 2018. In addition, KPMG in Singapore provided independent limited assurance on Ophir-Rochor Commercial’s green loan framework. [1] Refer to “Allianz and Gaw Capital joint venture to acquire Singapore’s marquee commercial real estate development DUO Tower and DUO Galleria”, 30 July 2019 [2] The low-emissivity glass helps to reduce the amount of heat entering the building, thereby lowering the energy needed to power air-conditioning.

The final nine SEs were selected based on rigorous criteria including the ability to address social needs, innovation, as well as the sustainability and scalability of their business models. They were also required to demonstrate a path to achieving key business and social impact milestones. The 2019 Singapore grant awardees (please see appendix for full list of awardees) include: • Agape, Connecting People (Agape) is a venture-backed contact centre services company with a social mission to empower the disadvantaged and marginalised – such as inmates, ex-convicts, single mothers and the disabled – with employment and income opportunities. Agape provides a suite of contact centre services and solutions tailored to suit their customers’ needs, including telemarketing, livechat, database maintenance and email management. The DBS Foundation grant will go into establishing a new training facility, developing a Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ)-Certified curriculum as well as subsidising course fees for marginalised groups. • NamZ is a food science company committed to creating a healthier planet through nutritious food that is also good for the environment. With their proprietary manufacturing technologies, they have created a revolutionary instant noodle product that is tasty, affordable, and rich in lean protein and fibre. Their instant noodles also boast a 300% reduced fat content relative to existing instant noodle products. NamZ is supporting smallholder farmers with better income, while the use of Future Fit Crops reduces the over-reliance on commodity crops. The DBS Foundation grant will be used to scale up production capacity, therefore making the nutritious noodles more accessible and widely available. • reach52 (previously Allied World Healthcare) is dedicated to delivering basic healthcare services in underserved communities and strengthening local health systems. They train and empower community members to use offline-first apps that connect them and their local communities to government support alongside affordable private sector services. reach52’s grassroots health access service is managed and run locally, hence creating jobs and income. The DBS Foundation grant will help build reach52’s partner management team and scale up social impact in one new market in Asia that is facing serious gaps in healthcare delivery. Said Karen Ngui, Board Member of DBS Foundation and DBS’ Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, “The DBS Foundation was formed five years ago and since then, we have witnessed a fast growing realisation of how businesses of all shapes and sizes can be a force for good. The record number of grant applications received this year is testament to the fact that more people, especially millennials, are passionate about creating innovative solutions to address a myriad of pressing social and environmental issues. From empowering the disadvantaged and marginalised, to creating nutritious food that benefits both the environment and smallholder farmers, we are delighted to support these inspiring social entrepreneurs as they strive to build a better future for all.” Wide-ranging support for social enterprises Over the last five years, DBS has been ramping up efforts to integrate SEs into the bank’s ecosystem by providing SEs with business and learning opportunities, and giving DBS’ customers and staff the opportunity to contribute towards a better world. While the bank has been supporting SEs for many years, it stepped up its commitment to the growth of social entrepreneurship with the establishment of the SGD 50 million DBS Foundation in 2014, to commemorate Singapore’s 50th year of independence. To date, DBS has reached out to more than 52,000 people, supported over 100 SEs with more than SGD 5 million in grant funding, and nurtured over 300 SEs through non-monetary forms of support. All around the world, SEs are gaining public attention for their contributions to business and social impact – nine DBS Foundation-supported SEs were named in 2018 and 2019 Forbes “30 under 30” lists. Under the DBS Social Enterprise Support Programme, the grant awardees stand to receive mentorship by DBS’ SME bankers, as well as banking and finance training courses at the DBS SME Academy. They will also be provided access to virtually free banking services through the bank’s decade-old DBS Social Enterprise Package, which comes with zero-minimum balance for account opening and unsecured loans at preferential rates. To raise awareness and interest beyond traditional philanthropy, DBS Private Bank runs a quarterly “Windows on Philanthropy” lunch series on impact investing and social entrepreneurship for its high-net-worth clients. In line with its commitment to advancing the sustainability agenda as a purpose-driven bank, the second season of DBS’ award-winning mini-series Sparks is also inspired by true stories of social enterprises across Asia.

DBS to adopt the Equator Principles,18 Nov 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_adopt_the_Equator_Principles, Singapore ,"- As part of its ongoing efforts in promoting responsible financing, DBS has become the first bank in Singapore and South East Asia to adopt the Equator Principles. The Equator Principles (EPs) is a globally recognised risk management framework adopted by financial institutions for determining, assessing and managing environment and social risk in development projects. The EPs also outline environmental and social standards for large scale developments and is based on the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards published by the World Bank Group. DBS’ adoption of the EPs would mean that the bank will go the extra mile in disclosing information related to large-scale developments that it is involved in. Currently, the bank already adheres to due diligence processes in accordance to IFC’s Performance Standards when assessing large project financing deals. Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Institutional Banking Group, DBS said, “We are proud to be the first bank in Singapore and Southeast Asia to be a signatory of the Equator Principles. We believe that the region will see significant infrastructure development over the next few years and financing will play a central role. As that happens, we acknowledge the importance of incorporating environmental and societal considerations into our lending decisions, and to managing our business in a balanced and responsible way, contributing to a more sustainable future.” DBS believes that Singapore’s position as a global financial centre and legal hub will also help create an inclusive environment to facilitate infrastructure projects in the region. Over the years, DBS has been focused on advancing the sustainability agenda with an approach based on three pillars: responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating social impact. In the area of responsible financing, this year, the Bank is expected to close more than SGD 4 billion of sustainable finance transactions comprising green loans, sustainability performance-linked loans and renewable energy financing. New milestones for sustainability-linked loans were also established across the region: Inked Singapore’s first sustainability-linked loan for an SME with leading egg producer Chew’s Agriculture; Signed first-of-its-kind SDG Innovation Loan with City Developments to accelerate innovative solutions that have a positive impact on SDGs; Signed Taiwan’s first sustainability-linked loan with AU Optronics. The loan is also the first of its kind for an IT company in Asia Pacific; Mandated Lead Arranger for the financing of three offshore wind farms in Taiwan worth SGD 8.5 billion equivalent. These wind farms will have a total installed capacity of 1.1GW and will supply clean energy to more than 900,000 Taiwanese; Advised and led the financing of Vena Energy’s 70MW ground mounted solar structure, Taiwan’s largest-to-date. Responsible banking practices encompass the bank’s commitment to include environmental and societal considerations in its day-to-day business operations. These include practices to minimise its environmental footprint, as well as support employees by embracing gender diversity and providing equal opportunity. On the social impact front, DBS recently launched the second season of its award-winning mini-series Sparks to shed light on some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of the day. The episodes were inspired by the stories of social enterprises supported by DBS Foundation, which has nurtured over 300 social enterprises and awarded over 100 social enterprises in Asia with more than SGD 4.7 million in grant funding.

"DBS partners with Exiger, tech leader in risk and compliance solutions, to fend off evolving risks of financial crime",15 Nov 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_with_Exiger_tech_leader_in_risk_and_compliance_solutions_to_fend_off_evolving_risks_of_financial_crime, Singapore ,"- To fend off the evolving risks of financial crime, DBS Bank has partnered with Exiger , the global leader in tech-enabled financial crime, risk and compliance solutions, to implement an artificial intelligence (AI) powered due diligence solution to streamline and further bolster the bank’s screening processes.  Designed by Exiger’s technologists and financial crime compliance specialists, the automated AI-powered solution, DDIQ , understands and analyses content with cognitive reasoning to accelerate and enhance risk assessments of clients, investments, transactions, third parties and counterparties. Findings from each level of risk assessment are recorded in the platform in a transparent and concise manner to ease the process of manually extracting and collating data for audit, compliance, and regulatory purposes.  In phase one, DBS will work with Exiger to deploy DDIQ’s AI-powered screening technology to initially enhance and complement the bank’s customer screening processes for institutional and retail clients in key markets and segments, with a view to using this capability more broadly.  Lam Chee Kin, Managing Director and Head, Group Legal, Compliance and Secretariat at DBS Bank said, “Using AI to help manage risk in financial crime is a journey that involves many small, difficult steps but tremendous ambition and commitment to keep moving. It is incumbent for financial institutions and their like-minded partners to continue to strive to give customers great experiences yet be adversarial to criminals and terrorists.”  Brandon Daniels, President of Global Technology Markets at Exiger, said, “Banks are quickly recognising that legacy systems and legacy technology will hold them back from achieving the next phase of growth and meeting increasingly demanding regulatory compliance requirements. DBS is cutting the path for traditional financial institutions to transform and compete in today’s digital market. It’s an honor to be a part of their leadership in financial services and to invest in what will set the standard for compliance departments across the world.”  The two organisations will continue to collaborate in accelerating adoption of AI in compliance, driving new ideas and innovation in banking.

DBS walks the talk on sustainability at Singapore Fintech Fest; showcases carbon-neutral booth and spearheads coffee recycling efforts,12 Nov 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_walks_the_talk_on_sustainability_at_Singapore_Fintech_Fest__showcases_carbon_neutral_booth_and_spearheads_coffee_recycling_efforts, Singapore ,"- As an advocate for sustainable practices, DBS Bank is proud to showcase its first carbon-neutral booth at the 2019 Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF). The Singapore Environment Council [1] (SEC), a recognised member of the Global Ecolabelling Network [2] , has been appointed as independent evaluator to calculate carbon emissions at the bank’s booth. To achieve carbon neutrality, DBS adopted the use of eco-friendly materials in the booth’s set up, such as flooring made from 95% compressed recycled straw. The bank also ensured that all furniture used at the booth were either from internal inventory or built sustainably with organic material from mushrooms by Mycotech , a social enterprise supported by the DBS Foundation. In addition, to ensure minimal waste, steel wires and pieces of carpentry used for showcases will be returned to suppliers and reused for other events. To offset the carbon footprint [3] from construction, a key feature at the DBS booth is its ‘hanging gardens’. Comprising a mix of lipstick plant and ivy, all greenery will be rehomed to the bank’s employees following the close of the festival this week. Karen Ngui, Managing Director and Head of Group Strategic Marketing and Communications at DBS Bank, said, “Creating a world that will last for generations to come will require individuals, organisations and nations to change mindsets and shift priorities, starting with simple changes in everyday habits. At DBS, we believe in sparking initiatives that will help to make meaningful and lasting impact in the communities which we operate in.” DBS has also teamed up with two other social enterprises supported by the DBS Foundation to tackle the issue of coffee waste at SFF. In collaboration with Bettr Barista and Edible Garden City , DBS will be collecting and recycling all used coffee grounds from the bank’s booth and across the three SFF cafes for use as compost [4] . The finished compost will subsequently be used as fertiliser for the bank’s edible gardens [5] which will be built at DBS Asia Hub (DAH) in 2020. Today, more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed across the globe every day, resulting in six million tonnes of used coffee grounds being sent off to landfill each year [6] . This is detrimental to the environment as decomposing coffee grounds release methane into the atmosphere due to anaerobic digestion in landfills and the lack of oxygen. Methane is known to be more harmful than carbon dioxide, as it has a global warming potential up to 86 times greater than carbon dioxide. DBS expects to collect 60 kilograms of used coffee grounds over three days, which is estimated to be able to fertilise its edible gardens at DAH for a year. DBS’ holistic approach to sustainability  Since February, DBS has formed four sustainability interest groups which are focused on initiatives to reduce food, fashion, plastic and paper waste. In addition, Sparks, DBS’ industry-first mini-series about banking and bankers, which launched since 2016, has recently launched its second season. Themed “Everyday Heroes for a Better World”, the new season of Sparks is inspired by social enterprises that are finding ways to address pressing social and environmental issues. The mini-series can be viewed at www.dbs.com/sparks as well as on Facebook and YouTube.

"DBS works with Singapore’s three healthcare clusters to transition all public hospitals, specialty centres and polyclinics to SGQR by end 2020",11 Nov 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_works_with_Singapores_three_healthcare_clusters_to_transition_all_public_hospitals_specialty_centres_and_polyclinics_to_SGQR_by_end_2020, Singapore ,"- In a push towards a cashless and chequeless society, DBS Bank is working with Singapore’s three public healthcare clusters, the National Healthcare Group (NHG), National University Health System (NUHS) and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth), on the payment infrastructure to transition all public hospitals, specialty centres and polyclinics to the nation’s unified payment code, Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR), by end 2020. Currently, around one in five consumers pay for their bills via cash or cheque [1] . Adopting a phased approach to encourage a gradual shift in consumer behaviour to digital payments, SGQR will be first launched across 27 public hospitals, specialty centres and polyclinics with effect from today. All a consumer needs to do, is to use his/her mobile phone to scan the SGQR code at the counter and key in the bill reference number to make payment. By unifying a multitude of QR payment options available in Singapore today, SGQR helps save consumers and counter staff the hassle of deciding which QR code for payment and collections – making the customer and employee journey a more seamless one. Mr Raof Latiff, Head of Digital, Institutional Banking, DBS Bank, said, “The unification of multiple QR codes into SGQR provides healthcare institutions and their customers greater freedom in the choice of payment platforms. With Singapore’s ageing population, having an easy-to-use digital payment method like SGQR is a progressive step to encourage wider e-payment adoption across various age demographics. In particular, SGQR will be helpful for elderly patients who wish to learn to be more digitally-saavy as all they have to do now, is to look out for one QR code at the counter or in their paper bills to make payment through their mobile phones instantly – saving them the hassle of shuffling through loose notes and coins, or issue cheques to make payment.” Ms Lim Yee Juan, Group Chief Financial Officer, NHG, said, “At the National Healthcare Group, we are constantly innovating to improve patient and caregiver experience. The adoption of SGQR reinforces our ethos of bolstering patient-centred care and population health through technology. We believe that SGQR will help our patients and caregivers save time in the bill payment process, as well as optimise service levels at our hospitals and polyclinics.” Ms Wong Soo Min, Group Chief Financial Officer, NUHS said, “At NUHS, we believe in delivering value-added care and services. As part of the service transformation for our entire cluster, SGQR dovetails many of our other patient-centred initiatives to simplify processes and improve the overall patient and caregiver experience. This will enable them to focus on their recovery journey instead.” Mr Johnny Quah, Deputy Group Chief Financial Officer (Shared Services and Research), SingHealth, said, “With an increasing number of e-payments options available in Singapore, patients may encounter multiple QR codes for different e-payment options when paying their bills in the hospital. SGQR allows SingHealth institutions to consolidate all eWallets in just one QR code, providing more options, convenience and a better payment experience for our patients. Additionally, it frees up counter space in the clinics for important patient care-related notices.” DBS’ efforts to encourage corporates to transition towards SGQR DBS has been working closely with statutory boards and corporate clients over the last 12 months to educate and encourage them to transition towards SGQR. “Payment transaction volumes via SGQR have been increasing steadily since its launch last year. Today, more than 32,000 SGQR codes have been deployed, representing one in five retail acceptance points nationwide [2] . To build on the momentum, we have spent close to 300 workshop hours with clients across multiple sectors this year to advise them on the benefits of the digital payment scheme and how to get started on their digitalisation journeys. These efforts have paid off translating to healthy traction in SGQR registrations across our customers, with one in two DBS PayNow Corporate [3] clients planning to transition to the unified payment code by end 2019,” said Mr Latiff. To spur more corporates to go digital, DBS was the first bank in Singapore to waive PayNow and FAST fees for corporate clients for their first 30 transactions every month until January 2020 and extend its waiver of inward PayNow fees till December 2021. This has led to a healthy pick-up in adoption rates for DBS digital payment solutions, such as QR-enabled DBS MAX, which has seen transaction volumes more than quadruple year-to-date. [1] Based on SingHealth’s statistics [2]  https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/2019/reply-to-parliamentary-question-on-the-adoption-rate-of-e-payments-in-singapore [3] DBS has around 40 per cent market share for PayNow Corporate registrations and half of the industry’s market share in terms of transaction volumes and value [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS and Trafigura collaborate with IMDA to launch open-sourced blockchain trade platform,06 Nov 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Trafigura_collaborate_with_IMDA_to_launch_open_sourced_blockchain_trade_platform, Singapore ,"- To leverage Singapore’s global trade connectivity [1] , DBS Bank and Trafigura, in collaboration with Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Enterprise Singapore and tradetech Perlin, have come together to develop an open-sourced blockchain trade platform (ICC TradeFlow platform) to connect trade partners across borders and streamline manual paper-based trade processes to improve trade flows. The platform’s pilot trade of USD20 million worth of iron ore will be shipped from Africa to China this month. Built on IMDA’s TradeTrust [2] network infrastructure and powered by Perlin’s blockchain technology, the platform is designed to be interoperable with existing and future digital trade platforms. This approach will enable companies based in digital harbours like Singapore to continue seamlessly trading with countries governed by traditional paper-based systems. All parties on the blockchain platform are also able to send, receive and act upon trade instructions in real-time, cutting the end-to-end trade document transit time by more than half from 45 to 20 days. Tan Su Shan, Head of Institutional Banking, DBS Bank, said, “DBS is pleased to lead the industry and work with global industry anchors such as Trafigura to co-create digital solutions to make the age-old business of trade finance more efficient, transparent and productive. By tapping into each other’s respective expertise in commodities and finance, our customers will be able to receive their goods at least 50% faster with much less paperwork. Solutions like these are timely as they meet our customers’ demands for increased transaction speed and optimised financing to promote better cash flow and capital management.” Tan Chin Hwee, Trafigura’s Asia-Pacific Chief Executive Officer, said, ""This is a Singaporean take on how to successfully adopt global trade finance technology under the leadership of governmental stakeholders. ICC TradeFlow, a distributed ledger system, is the first to be powered by the TradeTrust network. We would particularly like to thank IMDA, Enterprise Singapore, DBS and Standard Chartered Bank for their support and leadership on this initiative.” Leveraging the success of this initial pilot, the partners will continue iterating and improving the ICC TradeFlow platform, with a vision for global adoption. As next steps, further enhancements will be made to the platform. These include offering trade finance on-the-go, as well as providing background information and credit ratings on trade participants, vessels and couriers to build trust among counterparties – with the aim of achieving a more seamless trade process. John W.H. Denton AO, Secretary General of the ICC, said, “ICC TradeFlow is a transformative enterprise tool developed by our partner Perlin that we will champion for adoption internationally. With IMDA’s help and working with Trafigura and DBS, the ICC TradeFlow platform is uniquely placed to help gather the critical mass needed for a truly international and industry-wide shift from analog trade systems to digital ones. The technological, economic and governance-based precedents and standards set in Singapore will support adoption in other countries and ultimately greater growth in trade on a global scale.” Dorjee Sun, Chief Executive Officer of Perlin, said, “We are certain that blockchain will help drive the digitalisation of trade and transfer of title electronically. This will revolutionise trade, commodities and related finance and Singapore is at the forefront. We built ICC TradeFlow as the first working enterprise tool powered by TradeTrust with the vital help of our partners such as DBS and Trafigura, and are excited to work with the ICC for global adoption.” Mr Satvinder Singh, Assistant Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Singapore, said, “Home to a strong pool of international trading companies, Singapore is well-positioned to connect the industry players to innovations that can boost the overall efficiency of trade. Enterprise Singapore has been supportive of efforts in this aspect – from working with Perlin and ICC to establish the regional Centre of Future Trade in Singapore, to connecting them to partners such as DBS, Trafigura and IMDA to trial the use of blockchain for trade documentation. This partnership is a good start and we hope that it will encourage the business community to develop and pioneer new innovations that can reinforce Singapore’s position as a leading commodity trading hub.” Enhancing trade in tandem with IMDA’s TradeTrust network IMDA is spearheading the development of a globally trusted network, TradeTrust, for digital trade documentation exchange, and is working with various government agencies, including the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, Enterprise Singapore, Singapore Customs, Government Technology Agency, and industry partners such as Singapore Shipping Association. Conventional digitalisation efforts have given rise to increasingly fragmented digital ecosystems consisting of silo groups of user communities. TradeTrust works within this reality by enabling various enterprise and platform systems to effectively inter-operate. This will enable more seamless and efficient flow of goods between digitally inter-connected trading partners. This trusted network aims to reduce inefficiencies and complexities of cross-border trade arising from the current usage of paper-based documentation, such as bills of lading. This reduces operating costs for businesses, lowers risk of fraud and promotes more growth in trade. Jane Lim, Assistant Chief Executive, IMDA, said, “In the area of trade, technologies such as blockchain can help market participants move beyond traditional manual, paper-based processes, streamlining their trade processes for higher efficiency and cost savings. TradeTrust aims to inter-connect different trade platforms between paper to digital. We are pleased that Trafigura and DBS have leveraged the TradeTrust prototype in the ICC TradeFlow platform, and we look forward to work with more market participants globally to incorporate TradeTrust into their systems.” [1]  Singapore is connected to the world through a strong network of international trade agreements, which include 20 implemented Free Trade Agreements with 31 trading partners (Source: EDB Singapore) [2]  TradeTrust consists of a set of governance and legal frameworks, standards and a future-ready digital infrastructure, to facilitate the interoperability of electronic trade documents exchanged between different digital ecosystems.

"DBS woos startups in Software, Internet and Emerging Tech industries",01 Nov 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_woos_startups_in_Software_Internet_and_Emerging_Tech_industries, Singapore ,"- Asia is well-placed to create many of the future unicorns of the world, but support for unicorn-potentials in the technology space is lacking. Recognising this, DBS Bank is making available a comprehensive suite of banking and professional services – at zero cost – that high-growth startups in the Software, Internet and Emerging Technology industries need. ‘DBS Startup Unleashed’, a business toolkit, is being launched on the back of venture investors pouring an estimated SGD13.4 billion into startups [1] based in Singapore in the first nine months of 2019. Tan Su Shan, Managing Director and Group Head, Institutional Banking Group, DBS said that startups work hard to bring exponential ideas to life in the marketplace but often face considerable challenges as they also shoulder the daily responsibilities of running and growing a business. “DBS wants to bank Asia’s unicorns of tomorrow, today, as we believe that the startups in the Software, Internet and Emerging Technology industries will be the linchpin of the future economy. Due to the rapid adoption and availability of new technology, these startups are on the cusp of exponential growth as they develop next-generation solutions that meet the rapidly changing consumption needs in Asia and across the globe. To help these startups make headway as quickly as possible, DBS is doing whatever we can, from linking them to our ecosystem partners to providing relevant banking services to help them succeed.” The ‘DBS Startup Unleashed’ business toolkit will address the most pressing needs of these startups. It will comprise a broad suite of solutions for: • Everyday banking – startups will benefit from a fee-free multi-currency account across 13 currencies for day-to-day transactions and complimentary international funds transfers [2] ; • Transaction management and payments - complimentary set-up of DBS MAX [3] , a payment collection and cash management solution; • Co-creating digital solutions - complimentary access to DBS’ team of digital solution experts to design solutions powered by DBS APIs to help startups create plug and play impact from the get-go; • Accounting - complimentary access to online accounting software [4] so that cashflow and business projections can be managed through a one-stop digital dashboard; • Co-working spaces - complimentary co-working and co-creation space at DBS Asia X [5] (DAX), the Bank’s award-winning innovation facility; • Mentorship and networking through priority access to the DBS Startup Xchange programme – startups will benefit from partnership and co-creation opportunities to pilot their proof of concepts with DBS. The Startup Xchange programme will also open the door for startups to network and gain access to DBS’ ecosystem partners and test their latest solutions on segments of the DBS client base [6] . FINBOTS, a Singapore-based Intelligent Automation firm [7] who is already in the DBS Startup Xchange programme [8] is one company that is looking forward to benefitting from the solutions offered through the ‘DBS Startup Unleashed’ business toolkit. Sanjay Uppal, Founder and CEO, FINBOTS said, “As a startup, we are a business that has to constantly think of innovating our solutions, nurturing the talent that we have and ensuring that our customers get the best service and solutions possible. With the ‘DBS Startup Unleashed’ business toolkit, the banking solutions will help us save on everyday transactions even across borders. In addition, as we continue to tap into the DBS’ ecosystem through their Startup Xchange programme, we are already experiencing increased business momentum. We expect a significant uplift in revenue not just from our customers in Singapore but around the region as well.” Koh Shiyan, Managing Partner, Hustle Fund, a venture capital fund that invests in pre-seed software startups said that speed to market is the name of the game. “DBS’ Startup Unleashed toolkit is timely as it frees up resources for founders to focus on building their businesses instead of being stuck managing old-school administrative issues.

DBS CEO Piyush Gupta named among world’s top 100 best-performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review,29 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_CEO_Piyush_Gupta_named_among_worlds_top_100_Best_Performing_CEOs_by_Harvard_Business_Review," Singapore, Regional ","- Harvard Business Review (HBR) has named DBS CEO Piyush Gupta in their 2019 edition of “The CEO 100” , HBR’s annual list of the world’s top chief executives. He joins the likes of Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, Disney’s Robert Iger and Tencent’s Ma Huateng in the list this year, which sees NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang taking pole position. According to HBR, the ranking is based “not only on financial performance but also on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings”. This year, ESG scores have been weighted to account for 30% of each CEO’s final ranking – up from 20% in 2018, to reflect “the fact that a rapidly growing number of funds and individuals now focus on far more than bottom-line metrics when they make investment decisions”. In addition, HBR’s rankings rely on “objective measures over a chief executive’s entire tenure”, it said. Piyush joined DBS in 2009 as CEO, and has since led the bank on a transformation journey that has established the organisation as being among the world’s best. In September 2019, DBS was featured in HBR as among the world’s top 10 companies that have made most successful strategic transformations in the last decade. This year, DBS has also been recognised by Euromoney as the World’s Best Bank. This follows similar recognitions in 2018 from Global Finance and The Banker, making DBS the first bank to hold three global best bank titles at the same time. DBS Chairman Peter Seah said, “The board heartily congratulates Piyush on this well-deserved accomplishment. Piyush’s leadership, together with a committed management team, has been critical in reshaping the bank. Over the years, he has shown us time and time again what an outstanding chief executive he is – his vision, courage and tenacity, and most importantly, his steadfastness in wanting to do the right thing by our people and our communities. Being the first Singapore CEO to be featured on this list, Piyush has done us all proud by flying the Singapore flag high on the global stage once more.” DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “It is a honour to be included in HBR’s CEO 100 list and I am humbled by the recognition. I’ve been very fortunate at DBS to be supported by a board with great faith in our ability to become the world’s best, and to be the beneficiary of incredible teamwork and commitment from my colleagues. I’m confident we will continue to achieve greater heights together by maintaining our focus on being a purpose-driven organisation that reimagines banking.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS equips employees with skills to become everyday ‘Data Heroes’,24 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_equips_employees_with_skills_to_become_everyday_Data_Heroes, Singapore ,"- To further strengthen its digital capabilities and prepare its employees to be future-ready, DBS has equipped more than 16,000 of its employees with big data and data analytics skills over the last 18 months. The goals of DBS’ bank-wide upskilling programme are three-fold, namely to enhance employees’ ability to: 1. Use data to address business challenges in a highly-structured fashion, 2. Use data analytics to better identify business opportunities, and 3. Facilitate closer collaboration with the bank’s data scientists and technology teams so as to create more intuitive products and services for customers DBS’ ‘Data Heroes’ programme offers a comprehensive training curriculum that caters to different knowledge and skill levels across the bank – from novices whose day-to-day roles do not require them to have much interaction with data analytics to data experts looking to sharpen their skills. Employees will be able to learn at their own pace and select what they need to improve on from a range of online courses, workshops and community programmes. Through these programmes, DBS employees can learn more about the concept of becoming a data-driven organisation, the internet of things, data storytelling, responsible use of data and data visualisation. DBS has set a goal to enable our employees to be champions of lifelong learning, said Paul Cobban, Chief Data and Transformation Officer, DBS Bank. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and we need to ensure our staff have the knowledge, skills and tools to not only adapt to change, but also build communities with their peers so as to create a virtuous cycle of learning. By empowering our staff with new technical and soft skills, they’re more efficient and productive at work. This will enable them to have a more fulfilling career as well,” he said. One employee who has benefitted from the ‘Data Heroes’ programme is Nelson Lam from the bank’s Institutional Banking Operations team. One of Nelson’s responsibilities includes creating the monthly report on the bank’s corporate customer centre’s performance. “Having to churn out the same 10-page report every month was tedious and administrative, and I wanted to provide more actionable insights to my team. After attending the course, I could better analyse my data set to present more relevant and concise information to improve the team’s performance,” he said. DBS has seen success in leveraging the power of big data and analytics since 2014. Some examples include creating network analysis models to identify shell companies within money-laundering networks; using big data to halve attrition rates of new-to-bank wealth planning managers; and developing a system to detect abnormal transaction activities when handling trade finance mandates. The bank has been recognised for its digital innovation efforts and was named World’s Best Digital Bank by Euromoney twice in the last three years. It was also mostly recently recognised as one of the top 10 business transformations of the decade by the Harvard Business Review.

Singaporeans open to sustainable fashion but won’t pay more: DBS survey,23 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Singaporeans_open_to_sustainable_fashion_but_wont_pay_more__DBS_survey, Singapore ,"- Clothes shopping may be one of Singaporeans’ favourite pastimes, but this hobby could be contributing negatively to climate change [1] . The inaugural ‘Conscious Fashion’ survey [2] by DBS revealed that 7 in 10 Singaporeans do not ensure that the clothes they buy are sustainably made and sourced. This is even when 60% of respondents said they were aware that fashion is one of the largest contributors to pollution globally. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the global fashion industry produces 20% of global wastewater. When asked to rank the main barriers to changing their consumption behaviour, cost (35%), followed by apathy (25%) and a lack of variety and style (18%) came up tops. On a brighter note, the survey also found that if given the right nudge, 7 in 10 Singaporeans are open to recycling, swapping or upcycling their clothes to play their part in slowing climate change. Continuing its effort to spark conversations and galvanise change around key sustainability issues, DBS today unveiled the fourth episode in the second season of its award-winning mini-series Sparks. The episode is inspired by REmakeHub, a social enterprise that provides circular solutions to address waste pollution in the fashion industry, and its founder 27-year old Sissi Chao. The story revolves around Team DBS trying to think of out-of-the-box financial solutions to support Chao [3] , who is determined to make a lasting change in the fashion industry. The 13-minute episode was produced to encourage viewers to consider fashion purchases that are sustainably sourced and made. With 7 in 10 Singaporeans buying new clothes at least once every six months, DBS has also created an augmented reality game ‘Fashion Slowdown’ to bring home the message that everyone can play a part in contributing to a more sustainable future, even by simply shopping less. The game can be played at this link – www.go.dbs.com/fashionslowdown . Karen Ngui, Managing Director and Head of Group Strategic Marketing and Communications at DBS, said that even as the world grapples with the issue of climate change, small changes in behaviour can make a collective difference. “Each and every one of us has a responsibility to do our part, be it in big ways or small everyday ways, to reduce our carbon footprint. As an organisation that firmly believes in the importance of sustainability, we encourage our staff, our customers and the communities we operate in to reduce, reuse, recycle and adopt more socially-conscious, environmentally-friendly consumption habits.” Since February 2019, DBS has also formed four sustainability interest groups which are focused on initiatives to reduce fashion, food, plastic and paper waste. These groups bring together like-minded employees from across the bank to drive key sustainability initiatives. For example, to encourage more sustainable fashion choices among employees, DBS hosted its first-ever clothes swap event “Swap more, Shop less” at DBS Asia Central in March this year. More than 200 staff members participated and a total of over 200kg of clothing was collected, which is equivalent to saving more than 375,000 litres of water. “Swap more, Shop less” will be repeated this month so that employees can discover how sharing, recycling and conscious buying can help reduce not only their carbon footprint but also the cost of keeping their wardrobe up-to-date. Episode Five of Sparks Season Two will be launched in early November with a focus on ageing and an innovative solution to help the elderly stay active.   [1] According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , some 93 billion cubic metres of water - enough to meet the needs of five million people - is used by the fashion industry annually, and around half a million tons of microfibre, which is the equivalent of 3 million barrels of oil, is now being dumped into the ocean every year. UNCTAD estimates that every second, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned. [2] The DBS ‘Conscious Fashion’ survey conducted by YouGov interviewed 1,060 Singapore residents aged 18 years old and above on 10 and 11 October 2019. [3] Sabrina, the character inspired by Sissi Chao in episode four of Sparks Season Two, is played by Tess Pang.

DBS launches digital logistics solutions package for SME customers,09 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_digital_logistics_solutions_package_for_SME_customers, Singapore ,"- With e-commerce on the rise [1] , DBS will launch a digital logistics solutions package for SME customers in the space. The package will help Singapore-based SMEs in the logistics sector overcome expansion challenges and stay ahead of evolving consumer consumption patterns and emerging business trends across Asia.  The logistics sector in Singapore contributes around 7% to Singapore’s GDP [2] . As the Singapore market becomes more saturated and profit margins get tighter, SMEs in the logistics sector are looking to expand overseas. By growing their footprint regionally, they will be able to broaden their customer base and grow their revenue. However, they often face challenges such as access to trade financing solutions, operational inefficiencies from paper-based and manual processes, lack of supply chain traceability, as well as payments and collection inefficiencies. Launched at the Logistics Disrupt by DBS BusinessClass event, the DBS digital logistics solutions package will have digital solutions powered by DBS RAPID (Real-time APIs with DBS), such as supply chain financing and traceability, real-time trade financing application and funds settlement directly through their ERP or internal systems. It also includes instant payment collections and refund via the customers’ online portal, mobile app or DBS MAX. “Customers looking to expand overseas need more advisory services [3] and solutions and we are here to help them make the first step. We hope to make banking simpler and more seamless for our customers, so they have a more structured approach to their regionalisation plans,” said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Institutional Banking, DBS Bank. “The needs of SMEs in the logistics sector are diverse as they have to keep their eye on everything from inventory, timing of goods shipped and received, cash flow and expansion needs. As a responsible banking partner, we want to provide a greater selection of solutions that will help them grow their footprint,” said Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank. Yang Kee Logistics, a Singapore-based company set up in 1990 and a DBS customer since 2002 is the first to sign up for the package. The company is currently present in 12 markets and is looking to grow its footprint in the region. Said Ken Koh, Group CEO of Yang Kee Logistics, “Expanding into new markets is always challenging, we lack market knowledge and understanding of regulatory requirements. Partnering with DBS gives me the confidence to take our regionalisation plans to the next phase.” [1] According to a Google/Temasek study, Southeast Asia’s e-commerce is projected to grow to USD 100 billion by 2025. [2] Logistics is classified under the Transport and Storage sector. Full report can be found here - https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/economy [3] In a DBS survey conducted earlier this year, DBS found that 55% of SMEs cited the lack of market knowledge and understanding of regulatory requirements as the main challenges of overseas expansion. A quarter said that they could not find the right partner to collaborate with. [END] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

星展集團2019第四季投資展望,08 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/20191008_TW_zh_news_1, Taiwan ,- 星展銀行發佈2019年第四季投資展望，報告中指出，上一季(2019年第3季)市場發生了全球債券殖利率下滑創歷史新低、全球負殖利率債券的金額升至17兆美元(約佔全球投資等級債券總額30%)兩起重大事件，突顯在現金利率和債券殖利率處於零甚至負的環境下，「全球存款資金會往何處流動，才可創造正報酬？」的關鍵問題。星展集團認為，機構法人會因為沒有其他選項而轉向股票市場，除非中美爆發全面的貿易戰，否則上述資金的流入將可使股市表現相對較佳。星展持續偏好「槓鈴式策略建構投資組合」，建議投資人將資金著重於風險報酬的兩端：一端是創造收益的資產，可佈局類債券的高股息收益型股票；另一端則是受惠於世界潮流的成長型股票，看好可受惠於數位化、人口老化以及可持續性趨勢的產業。 報告重點摘要如下： 風險性資產獲得支撐 除非爆發全面性的貿易戰，儘管經濟成長減緩，全球央行的寬鬆措施仍可望為企業債和股市帶來支撐。 以槓鈴式投資策略（Barbell Strategy）因應變化多端的市場 採用槓鈴式投資組合在這個瞬息萬變的世界破浪前行。在利率接近零的環境下看好可受惠於數位化、人口老化、可持續性題材和創造收益型資產等具有長期成長趨勢的產業。同時可納入黃金於投資組合中，藉以提升整體投資組合的韌性。 新“類債券型資產” 隨著全球投資等級債券中，約30%的債券為負殖利率，達歷史新高，收益型股票可望成為替代債券的資產。亞洲不動產投資信託（REITs）、中國大型銀行、歐洲綜合能源企業以及歐洲銀行額外一級資本（AT1）債也都是可持續的收益型資產。債市部分，仍舊相對看好評等為BBB/BB的債券，存續期間則是介於4至5年之間較佳。

DBS named Asia’s Safest Bank for 11th consecutive year,02 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_Asias_Safest_Bank_for_11th_consecutive_year," Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, China, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Bank today announced that it has retained the title of “Safest Bank in Asia” for the 11th consecutive year, awarded by New York-based trade publication Global Finance. DBS remains the fourth-safest commercial bank in the world, and 14th safest on Global Finance’s list of the World’s 50 Safest Banks. Joseph D. Giarraputo, Global Finance publisher and editorial director, said, “Asia’s export stability is currently being tested by tectonic shifts in trade policy. The banks that earn Safest ratings help their clients maintain stability in the face of rapid change and growing uncertainty. These even-keeled institutions are well-equipped to steer through any turmoil.” “DBS’ expansion strategy is vindicated by its consistent ranking as the ‘Safest Bank in Asia’, and among the safest banks in the world. Given current global economic turbulence, financial stability is more important than ever, and DBS’ steadying hand remains a beacon to its clients,” added Global Finance. Said Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Bank, “We are honoured that Global Finance has recognised us as the Safest Bank in Asia for the 11th year running. Our consistently strong placement in these rankings is testament to our long-standing customer relationships, earnings power and solid capital base. As we continue to define the future of banking, we remain committed to upholding the trust that our stakeholders have come to expect of us.” Global Finance’s annual ranking of the World’s 50 Safest Banks has been the recognised and trusted standard of financial counterparty safety for a quarter-century. Winners were selected through an evaluation of long-term foreign currency ratings — from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch — of the 500 largest banks worldwide. This year, DBS has also been recognised by Euromoney as the World’s Best Bank. This follows similar recognition in 2018 from Global Finance and The Banker, who named the bank the “Best Bank in the World” and “Bank of the Year – Global”, respectively, making DBS the first bank in the world to hold all three titles at the same time.

DBS and IRAS work towards Singapore’s target to be cheque-free by 2025,01 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_IRAS_work_towards_Singapores_target_to_be_cheque_free_by_2025, Singapore ,"- In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation agenda, DBS Bank is collaborating with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) to digitalise tax payouts and collections via PayNow to encourage more businesses to go cheque-free. IRAS first introduced PayNow as an option for businesses to receive Wage Credit Scheme [1] (WCS) payouts in March, resulting in a 20 per cent reduction in cheque volumes to-date. Before the implementation of PayNow, about half of WCS-eligible businesses, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), chose to receive their payouts via cheques. Ms Ang Sor Tjing, Director of IRAS’ Revenue and Payment Management Branch said, “Implementing PayNow for the disbursement of the scheme’s payouts helps encourage businesses, many of which comprise SMEs, to go chequeless and transition towards digital payments. As part of IRAS’ digitalisation drive, we are also working with DBS to expand the use of PayNow to more services for the convenience of businesses and individuals.” Mr Raof Latiff, Group Head of Digital, Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank said, “Acceptance of digital transactions among individuals in Singapore has been well established. To bring Singapore’s digital agenda to fruition, it is critical to encourage SMEs to get on board the digital payments train as they represent 99 per cent of businesses locally. Partnering with statutory boards like IRAS is one of the key ways to encourage this shift, with them leading the way by digitalising payments and collections channels across their suite of services.” For the next phase, both parties are working together to leverage DBS’ APIs (application programming interface) to digitalise IRAS’ stamp duty services. Currently, most taxpayers tend to pay for conveyancing stamp duty [2] via cheques and have to wait several days for the cheque to be cleared before a stamp duty certificate is issued. However, with DBS’ Direct Debit Authorisation (DDA) API, taxpayers can set up a GIRO account online, and make payment for their stamp duty and receive a stamp certificate through IRAS’ e-Stamping Portal instantly. In addition, with a transfer limit of SGD200,000 per transaction, the DBS DDA solution also enables IRAS to digitalise payments for the majority of conveyancing stamp duty transactions. This new DDA e-payment option for conveyancing stamp duty will be launched in November, and more details can be found on the IRAS website closer to the launch date. “Besides stamp duty payments, with cashless payments gaining momentum in Singapore, taxpayers are encouraged to use cashless or electronic payment modes such as GIRO and online banking to fulfil their other tax obligations,” said Ms Ang. DBS continues to see traction from SMEs in the adoption of PayNow DBS currently banks more than one in two SMEs in Singapore and continues to see healthy interest from the segment to digitalise their businesses. Since PayNow was launched to corporates in August last year, DBS has seen a steady increase in SMEs adopting the digital payment collections solution, with the bank holding close to 40 per cent of the market share by registrations to date. From a transactions perspective, DBS’ corporate clients contribute to more than half of PayNow Corporate receipts in Singapore, with volumes from the bank’s SME customers growing threefold to date. This was mainly driven by healthy take-up of the bank’s PayNow-integrated QR payment solution, DBS MAX, which led to a doubling in digital payment and collection transactions by SMEs since the solution was launched in November 2018. “Singapore has continued to show steady progress in the adoption of digital payments on the back of the government’s continuous push to become a Smart Nation.

台灣製造（MIT）重新受到關注 - 研究報告,01 Oct 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/20191001_TW_zh_news_1, Taiwan ,"- 身為全球最佳銀行，星展銀行對於國際市場擁有卓越的前瞻洞悉力。今天，要和各位分享星展集團資深經濟學家馬鐵英針對台灣製造（MIT）提出之研究報告，以及星展對1)台灣對美國出口的增長、2）海外生產比率的下降、 3）在“投資台灣”呼籲之下投資申請的激增，以及4）實際投資指標的回升的觀察。 台灣製造（MIT）受到關注 經過二十年的投資外流以及產業中空化，受外部推動以及內部拉動因素的共同作用，“台灣製造”（MIT）又重新受到關注。 經過二十年的投資外流以及產業中空化，“台灣製造”（MIT）又重新受到關注。這是受外部推動以及內部拉動因素的共同作用的結果。一方面，目前中美貿易戰已迫使在中國大陸的一些台灣企業將生產轉移回台灣。對“中國製造”（MIC）產品加徵更高的關稅、對中國科技企業進行制裁以及重要的是，中美關係持續存在不確定性，都提升了供應鏈多元化的需求。另一方面，台灣政府提出了所謂的“投資台灣”的口號來吸引在大陸有運營的企業回到台灣投資。一攬子扶持措施已在年初啟動，包括優惠租金、低息貸款、就業補貼、簡化的行政程序等等。 令人鼓舞的景象 令人鼓舞的跡象顯示，MIT已開始產生動能。首先，台灣對美國的出口增長明顯。今年1-8月台灣對美國市場的出口平均增長了18.6%，去年增速則為7.6%。台灣與美國的貿易盈餘由18年12月的50億美元擴大至19年8月的79億美元（12個月滾動總和）。美國的進口市場中，台灣份額也有所增加，由一直開打之前的18年6月的1.8%上升到19年7月的2.2%。辦公機械、自動化數據處理設備、電信和錄音設備出口份額的增長最為顯著。 第二，台灣的海外生產比率（OPR）下降。今年1-7月整體OPR降至平均的50.5%，低於2018年的52.1%。尤其是，信息和通信產品的OPR同期下跌整整2個百分點到92%。 第三，“投資台灣”口號下投資申請激增。據投資台灣辦公室的統計，年初至今（截止9月6日）已收到129家在海外有運營的台灣企業的投資申請，金額總計達到5767億台幣（佔GDP的3%）。比如說，世界最大的筆記型電腦製造商廣達（Quanta）,已宣佈拿出42.8億台幣在北部的桃園市收購土地並建廠。世界最大的自行車製造商捷安特（Giant）,宣佈拿出50億台幣在中部的台中市擴大生產線。全球最大的開關電源供應商台達（Delta）,表示未來三年將總計投資132億台幣在台北、桃園、台中和台南。官方估算，2019年投資申請總計將達到7000-8000億台幣，其中1868億台幣將在於年內實現投放。 實際的投資指標也有所上揚。GDP口徑下總固定資本形成（GFCF）在今年上半年同比勁增7.2%，遠超2018年的2.5%。今年GFCF有望實現5-6%的增長，成為九年來最高增速。 MIC vs MIT: 深度研究 我們比較12個供應端的因素來研究當前從MIC轉換到MIT是否具有經濟理性。 1.人力成本：目前大陸的人力成本仍比台灣廉價，但差距在大幅收窄。2008-18年期間，由於經濟快速增長和人口老齡化，大陸的平均工資年增長14%。相比之下，同期台灣每年的工資增速平均為2%。因此，大陸的工資水平目前相當於台灣的60%左右，在2000年時則為7%。 2.土地成本：大陸的土地成本比台灣便宜，而且差距依然很大。儘管過去二十年隨著工業化和城鎮化的快速發展，大陸整體地價激增，但台灣地價因供應緊張也出現上漲。正如圖表1所示，大陸主要城市的工業用地價格依然遠低於台灣同類城市，約為台灣的10%。 3.能源成本：兩個經濟體之間的能源成本並無明顯差異。由於經濟強勁增長以及大宗商品的旺盛需求，過去十年大陸的電價和燃油價格出現了穩步上漲。台灣已經面臨類似的問題，但主要是由於全球大宗商品價格上漲帶來的傳導效應，以及島內核電依賴降低的因素。 4.物流成本：物流成本並無十分大的不同。港口/機場運力以及高速公路網絡的擴張幫助大陸提高了運輸效率，降低了相關成本。世界銀行的物流績效指數將中國大陸列為全球26位，與台灣比肩。 5.交易成本：大陸的機構交易成本相對較高。得益於穩步的改革和去監管，中國大陸在世界銀行的營商便利度調查中的排名出現了顯著提升（2019年為46位，2007年為93位）。但與包括台灣在內的本地區相對成熟的經濟體相比，仍為落後。 6.融資成本：大陸的融資成本始終高於台灣，反映出大陸旺盛的借款需求和偏緊的流動性條件。過去十年，3個月期SHIBOR和TAIBOR之間的平均利差寬達300個基點（若經通脹調整為160個基點）。目前，大陸的1年期貸款市場報價利率為4.25%，台灣的基準貸款利率為2.64%。 7.匯率：自2005年人民幣正式不盯住美元以來，在大陸的出口商一直面臨著貨幣升值帶來的額外成本負擔。但近幾年事情有了變化。由於2015年匯率改革，經常帳盈餘收窄以及最近與美國的貿易戰，2016年以來人民幣的升值壓力已經減弱。人民幣與新興市場其他貨幣的聯動性增強——18年1月至19年8月期間，美元/人民幣和美元/台幣的關聯度高達0.94。 8.稅收成本：大陸的企業稅負儘管因穩步的財政改革而不斷下降，但依然相對較高。目前大陸的企業整體稅率為25%，比台灣高出5個百分點。若考慮到僱主的社保繳納，這個差距甚至更大。 9.關稅成本：大陸的關稅成本較高而且處於升勢。大陸對進口品徵收的加權平均關稅稅率為3.83%，台灣為1.86%（世界銀行，2017年）。由於近來與美國的貿易關係緊張，中國同美國的貿易關稅大幅提高。根據我們的估算，截止9月19日，中國對美國出口品的加權平均關稅稅率上升到了15%，到19年12月勢必會進一步上升超過20%。 10.生產率：生產率提高有助於抵消工資增長，保持單位人工成本穩定，因而提升製造業競爭力。按照每名工人的產出來衡量，2000-08年大陸的勞動生產率每年平均上升9%，遠超台灣的3%。然而，這不足以抵消大陸較快的工資增長。而且目前大陸的勞動生產率水平仍相對較低（為台灣的1/3）。 11.自動化：自動化是提高生產率和應對勞動力短缺問題的必要途徑。儘管台灣的製造商近幾年已經開始在其大陸工廠安裝自動化設備，但在台灣也是如此。台灣的總體自動化進程要比大陸快，這從機器人密度等指標中可以判斷。 12.知識產權：知識產權保護是創新、技術進步和生產率提升的基本。大陸對知識產權的保護比較薄弱，這是目前與美國的貿易糾紛的一個關鍵問題。台灣擁有相對健全的法律制度來保護知識產權，這從國際調查中可以發現。 總之，在上面討論的這12個供應端因素中，就目前的人工和土地成本而言，大陸仍比台灣具有更大的競爭力，不過人工成本差距在大幅收窄。台灣在其他幾個領域包括融資/稅收/關稅/交易成本，生產率水平，自動化程度和知識產權保護中表現突出。 因此，從MIC轉換到MIT對於高價值、低勞動密度的工作來說更為合理。台灣企業利用台灣成熟的勞動力、強大的技術能力以及發達的物理和軟基礎設施在島內生產高端產品是明智之舉。 與此同時，對於出口美國市場的產品，MIT應是正確之選。美國對中國出口品加徵的高額關稅對大陸的台灣企業的利潤率影響重大。具體來說，大陸工人目前賺取相當於台灣工人60%的工資，這意味著節省40%。若假設人工成本佔總成本的1/4，那麼總的節省將是10%。不過，這會被美國對中國出口品加徵的15-30%的關稅所輕易抵消。 MIT的興起並不意味著大陸將會失去作為台灣企業主要製造樞紐的地位。對於具有較高勞動內容以及/或針對大陸市場/非美國海外市場的產品來說，在大陸進行生產仍具有意義。 最後，不論MIT能否普遍興起，未來更為可持續的基礎將會取決於在台灣如何應對勞動力和土地問題。有效的措施將會包括進一步促進自動化技術的運用、放寬外國工人就業規定、打壓土地囤積/投機活動、增加工業園區公共土地供應等等。"

DBS among top 10 business transformations of the decade: Harvard Business Review,27 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_among_top_10_business_transformations_of_the_decade__Harvard_Business_Review_19," Singapore, Regional ","- In a 2019 study of companies around the world that have made the most successful strategic transformations in the last decade, DBS Bank ranks among the top 10, according to Harvard Business Review . In this achievement, DBS joins the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Tencent and Alibaba, who were similarly recognised. The study – “ The Transformation 20: The top global companies leading strategic transformations ” – by strategy consulting firm Innosight involved the screening of all companies in the S&P 500 and Global 2000 using three lenses: new growth, repositioning the core and financials. The final 2019 Transformation 20 “ranked highest in their new-growth transformation. Each excelled in the development of new products, services and business models; repositioning its core business; and financial performance”, it said. DBS was also recognised for “transforming from a traditional regional bank to a global digital platform company, around a culture-based vision of becoming a 27,000-person startup”. The Innosight study identified that the top 20 most transformative companies had certain ingrained behaviours. These included creating a higher-purpose mission, seizing the digital opportunity via new platforms and business models, and ensuring that innovation was not isolated to a department but was a strategic capability. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We are delighted that DBS continues to be recognised as being among the world’s best for our digital transformation. Conventional wisdom is that it is difficult for a legacy company to transform at scale. Our own journey has shown otherwise, and what has worked for us is attacking the core; making transformation mainstream by changing culture company-wide. A few years ago, in running the company, we started to act less like a bank and more like a tech company. That startup culture has infused the entire organisation from top to bottom, front to back, enabling us to truly reimagine banking.” This year, DBS has also been recognised by Euromoney as the World’s Best Bank. This follows similar recognitions in 2018 from Global Finance and The Banker, making DBS the first bank to hold three global best bank titles at the same time.

DBS aims to more than double DBS PayLah! users to 3.5 million by 2023,25 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_aims_to_more_than_double_DBS_PayLah_users_to_3_5_million_by_2023, Singapore ,"- DBS PayLah!, one of Singapore’s most popular mobile wallets, aims to more than double its existing user base of 1.6 million to 3.5 million by 2023. To achieve this, the bank will over the course of 2020 integrate its DBS Lifestyle rewards app into DBS PayLah!, link debit and credit cards payments to the DBS PayLah! platform so customers can choose their preferred way to pay, expand payment touchpoints across the region, and ramp up on its DBS PayLah! ecosystem partnerships. It has signed more than 10 strategic platform partnerships with merchants across key lifestyle verticals, and users can look forward to more merchants coming onboard the platform over the next few months, including KFC, SISTIC and AXS. “DBS PayLah! is one of the bank’s signature offerings, and its introduction in Singapore has fundamentally transformed the way consumers shop and pay,” said Anthony Seow, Head of Payments & Platforms, Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank. “In 2020, we’ll be building on the three Ps – Payments, Partners and Platform – as part of a longer-term strategic roadmap. By linking DBS/POSB debit and credit cards – Singapore’s most popular form of payment – and integrating the DBS Lifestyle rewards app into DBS PayLah!, our customers will be able to earn and redeem rewards instantly on a single platform simply and seamlessly, regardless of their mode of payment.” First launched in 2014, DBS PayLah! has radically transformed Singapore’s payments landscape. Today, some 70% of Singaporeans use a digital wallet [1] . Of these, four in 10, or 1.6 million people, are DBS PayLah! users. These users made SGD 1.5 billion in transactions in the last 12 months [2] . DBS PayLah!’s peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-business (P2B) fund transfer services are also integrated with PayNow and PayNow Corporate. PayNow recently hit 2.8 million registrants [3] , of which DBS/POSB holds the lion’s share of around 65%. DBS PayLah!’s first-mover advantage in the QR code payments space – the app was the first in Singapore to give users the ability to send and receive funds via QR codes – also means that most NETS QR code payments today are made by DBS PayLah! users. DBS PayLah! users today can buy travel insurance, book movie tickets, pay bills and transport expenses, browse entertainment and dining offers, make fund transfers and scan to pay for their purchases at more than 80,000 NETS QR, SGQR and PayNow QR-enabled merchants island-wide. “DBS PayLah! has been very simple and convenient for my friends and I to use – I really like that I only need my friend’s mobile number to go ahead with the split bill payment function, and I don’t have to top up separately given the auto-debit function. Most of my friends have DBS PayLah! as well,” said DBS PayLah! user Tay Zi Jiang, 30 years old, analyst. “Besides the cashback promos and discounted offers available from the merchants, it’s also useful to have everyday functionalities built in so I don’t have to use separate apps for them.” In commemoration of its fifth anniversary, DBS will roll out a slew of exciting merchant promos and dollar deals over the next few months.

DBS to double wealth business in Thailand by 2023,18 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_double_wealth_business_in_Thailand_by_2023," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, today announced a partnership between DBS Private Bank and DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand), with plans to double its wealth assets under management in Thailand from SGD 4 billion to SGD 8 billion by 2023. Targeting Thailand’s growing pool of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) who are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios and access investment opportunities overseas, the partnership seeks to provide wealth clients in Thailand with seamless access to a fully integrated onshore and offshore wealth management proposition – the first in Thailand to do so. To cater to rising demand, DBS also aims to double its headcount for wealth relationship managers (RMs) in Thailand by 2023.  Thailand’s wealth population has shown rapid growth over the years. The nation is home to over 122,000 HNWIs [1] as of 2017, almost equal to the number of HNWIs in Singapore. Thai wealth assets under management have grown at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7% between 2010 to 2017 [2] . Today, much of Thai wealth is held in family-owned businesses, which are key drivers of Thailand’s economy – accounting for more than 80% of the nation’s GDP and over one-third of listed firms on the Stock Exchange of Thailand [3] . DBS believes that these family businesses will be well-served by the bank’s unique “one-bank” proposition, which provides access to offerings across wealth management, retail, investment and corporate banking. The partnership brings together the best of both entities: DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand)’s comprehensive onshore offering across funds, equities, structured notes and bonds, as well as strong Thai market advisory, will be complemented with DBS Private Bank’s global wealth expertise, extensive Asian network and full suite of offshore wealth management solutions and platform – all seamlessly delivered to clients via their RM, who will serve as a single point of contact. This first-in-market “one-stop” proposition enables DBS’ wealth clients in Thailand to conveniently access and manage their investments in one place. In contrast, existing market practices require investors to go through separate entities for their investment needs – one for onshore and another for offshore. Said Sim S Lim, Group Head of Wealth Management and Consumer Banking, DBS Bank, “This partnership represents our commitment to growing our business in Thailand. We believe the Thai wealth market holds immense potential, having witnessed Thai investors’ growing sophistication and receptiveness to investment ideas, and the Bank of Thailand’s encouraging regulatory stance towards offshore investments. We’ve served Thai investors for over two decades through our securities business and understand their needs and preferences. With our strong Asian expertise and connectivity, leading digital capabilities, and reputation as Asia’s safest and the world’s best – we seek to become a trusted partner by providing customers with seamless access to opportunities and wealth management solutions both within and beyond Thailand’s shores.” Said Pattera Dilokrungthirapop, CEO, DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand), “HNWIs in Thailand are relatively conservative with offshore investments, but this is beginning to change. As their personal wealth grows, we’re seeing corresponding demand for holistic wealth management services and global investment strategies. Today, what they want is a ‘one-stop shop’ that provides trusted advisory, wealth products and solutions, and a seamless onshore and offshore experience – a gap that DBS can effectively fill through this partnership.” DBS has been operating a securities business in Thailand since 1998. Today, DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand) holds a full securities licence and has established its position as a leading securities company in Thailand. In 2018, DBS Private Bank was awarded “Best Private Bank in Asia-Pacific” by Global Finance and “Best Private Bank for Innovation” by Private Wealth Management/ The Banker.

DBS makes Dow Jones Sustainability Index (Asia Pacific) for second consecutive year,17 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_makes_Dow_Jones_sustainability_index_Asia_Pacific_for_second_consecutive_year, Singapore ,"- DBS is the only bank in Southeast Asia and one of five Singapore-listed companies to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia Pacific 2019 for the second consecutive year. Designed to measure the performance of the region’s leading organisations in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria, the DJSI Asia Pacific serves as a reliable and credible benchmark for investors who integrate sustainability considerations into their portfolios. Earlier this year, in July, DBS had also been named to the FTSE4Good Global Index for the third year running, having been the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index in 2017. The index is designed to identify companies that demonstrate strong environmental, social and governance practices measured against globally recognised standards. Said Mikkel Larsen, Chief Sustainability Officer at DBS, “Sustainability permeates all our practices at DBS. Whether it is through our banking business, business operations or the DBS Foundation, we recognise our purpose as a leading bank in Asia to create long-term economic, social and environmental value. Being named to two globally renowned indices – the DJSI Asia Pacific and FTSE4Good Global Index – yet again is a great honour and reflects our determination to build a more sustainable and inclusive world for future generations.” Said Manjit Jus, Head of ESG Ratings, RobecoSAM: “We congratulate DBS for being included in the DJSI Asia Pacific. The SAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment (SAM CSA) has again raised the bar in identifying those companies best-positioned to address future sustainability challenges and opportunities. This year – which marks the 20th anniversary of the DJSI – record corporate interest in the SAM CSA reflects the enduring relevance of the DJSI for measuring and advancing ESG practices."" Over the years, DBS has been focused on advancing the sustainability agenda with an approach based on three pillars: responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating social impact. In the area of responsible financing, DBS provided sustainability financing comprising green loans, sustainability performance-linked loans and renewable energy financing that amounted to more than SGD 2.4 billion in 2018. This year, new milestones for sustainability-linked loans were also established across the region: Inked Singapore’s first sustainability-linked loan for an SME with leading egg producer Chew’s Agriculture [1] Signed first-of-its-kind SDG Innovation Loan with City Developments Limited to accelerate innovative solutions that have a positive impact on SDGs [2] , and Signed Taiwan’s first sustainability-linked loan with AU Optronics. The loan is also the first of its kind for an IT company in Asia Pacific [3] . Responsible banking practices encompass the bank’s commitment to include environmental and societal considerations in its day-to-day business operations. These include practices to minimise its environmental footprint, as well as support employees by embracing gender diversity and providing equal opportunity. On the social impact front, DBS recently launched the second season of its award-winning mini-series Sparks to shed light on some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of the day. The episodes were inspired by the stories of social enterprises supported by DBS Foundation, which has nurtured over 300 social enterprises and awarded over 100 social enterprises in Asia with more than SGD 4.7 million in grant funding. This year, DBS and Singapore Management University (SMU) established the DBS-SMU Sustainability Initiative, a three-year partnership to promote sustainability in the region. This includes the introduction of Singapore’s first sustainability major, scholarships, fellowships, and internships with social enterprises backed by DBS Foundation. More recently, the bank also launched the inaugural DBS Foundation Social Impact Prize, a new category in the biennial Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition. The prize aims to identify sustainable, scalable and enterprising business solutions from across the world that help address crucial social problems and make cities of the future more inclusive, healthier and greener.

DBS Launches its first multi-tier financing facility on blockchain platform to help SMEs in China get faster access to trade financing,11 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Launches_its_first_multitier_financing_facility_on_blockchain_platform_to_help_SMEs_in_China_get_faster_access_to_trade_financing," Singapore, China ","- DBS Bank today announced its first multi-tier financing facility on a logistics blockchain platform named Rong-E Lian, to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China get faster access to trade financing. Developed in partnership with a leading Chinese logistics player, Rong-E Lian offers multi-tier financing solutions to more than 1,000 of suppliers in the company’s supply chain ecosystem. The multi-tier financing solution [1] is particularly beneficial to suppliers embedded beyond the first layer of the logistics supply chain ecosystem, as they include SMEs which may have limited access to trade financing due to their lack of scale or credit history. Leveraging on DBS’ Application Programming Interface (APIs), the bank integrated its digital onboarding service into the blockchain platform, allowing DBS to verify the credentials of a supplier within seconds. Once credentials are verified, the bank is then able to offer digital trade financing services to upstream suppliers, often SMEs, in the ecosystem within 24 hours. Neil Ge, CEO of DBS China, said: “Cash flow is critical to the sustainability of any business, but even more so for SMEs. However, more than half of SMEs globally tend to face rejection by financial institutions for their trade finance needs, contributing to the world’s trade finance gap of USD 1.3 trillion [2] . By using new technologies such as blockchain and APIs, we hope to democratise trade finance by providing SMEs more affordable and convenient access to bank credit to enable them to realise their business ambitions, serve their customers well and expand into new markets with ease.” DBS has successfully completed its first multi-tier financing transaction on the Rong-E Lian blockchain platform with suppliers in the China-based logistics supply chain ecosystem in August. This comes on the back of the bank’s other efforts to explore initiatives to deepen and broaden its partnership with businesses in the Greater Bay Area region. For instance, DBS was the first foreign bank to digitalise cross-border settlements with a one-stop digital payments and collections solution called DigiDocs in July. In addition, DigiDocs also offers the online booking of foreign exchange rates, allowing DBS customers to select their preferred exchange rate according to market real-time quotes for remittance payments. Ginger Cheng, Head of Large and Mid-cap Corporates, Institutional Banking Group, DBS China said, “DBS believes in the huge growth potential in the Greater Bay Area, also known for being the ‘Silicon Valley of the East’. This is a groundbreaking transaction for DBS in China as we use digital technologies to develop new business models with our corporate clients. As part of our digital transformation strategy, we integrated financial services into the blockchain platform to develop a new business model and better serve upstream suppliers. As such, we are able to provide integrated trade financing, giving suppliers easy access to financing on-the-go. This is especially beneficial to SMEs as they are offered credit on better terms. We look forward to collaborating with more companies to co-create innovative digital client solutions for supply chains in China.” Committed to building digital trade ecosystems Last year, DBS launched several digital trade ecosystems.

CDL and DBS set benchmark on innovation focused financing for sustainable development,04 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/CDl_and_DBS_set_benchmark_on_innovation_focused_financing_for_sustainable_development, Singapore ,"- City Developments Limited (CDL) has secured a S$250 million SDG Innovation Loan, in the form of a three-year revolving credit facility provided by DBS Bank Ltd. (DBS). This is a first-of-its-kind concept that CDL has pioneered for a sustainability-linked loan to accelerate innovative solutions that have a positive impact on SDGs. The SDG Innovation Loan will be used for CDL’s general working capital and corporate funding. The company will be eligible for a discount on the interest rate of the loan when it achieves sustainability-related performance targets mutually agreed with DBS on innovations 1 that contribute positively to the SDGs. To qualify, CDL is required to be the first in Singapore to adopt and apply such innovations to its projects. An authoritative expert or expert panel 2 will be appointed to independently assess and endorse the innovative nature of CDL’s proposal against market norms. In addition, CDL must remain listed on at least one leading global sustainability index. CDL’s SDG Innovation Loan supports SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and SDG 13: Climate Action. It complements global sustainability trends and answers the Singapore government’s call for climate action, smart cities, green innovation as well as sustainable development and financing. In his 2019 National Day Rally speech 3 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted climate change as one of the gravest challenges facing humankind and the need to understand, mitigate and adapt to climate change. For the private sector specifically, Minister for National Development and Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong, speaking at the 5th Urban Sustainability R&D Congress 4 on 23 July 2019, encouraged the adoption of technology and innovation to create positive impact and build a better city. In 2015, a total of 17 SDGs 5 were adopted by UN Member States including Singapore as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to mobilise efforts to tackle issues such as poverty, inequality and climate change. Having integrated environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices into its business for over two decades, CDL adopts green finance as a natural progression of its long-standing commitment to sustainable development and low carbon operations. In 2017, CDL issued the first green bond by a listed Singapore real estate company. The green bond raised S$100 million which was used to repay a related company loan that financed various initiatives to enhance energy and water efficiency at Republic Plaza, CDL’s flagship Grade A office building in the heart of Singapore’s Central Business District. In April 2019, CDL secured its first green loans amounting to S$500 million, marking the first time that green loans in Singapore would be used for new property developments. Mr Sherman Kwek, Group Chief Executive Officer of CDL , said, “Green financing offers an alternative financing avenue and plays a pivotal role in channelling capital towards building greener and more climate-friendly infrastructure. CDL’s green bond and green loans have enabled us to tap like-minded banks and partners that are supportive of our sustainability best practices while establishing a closer alignment of our ESG commitments with socially responsible investors. Innovation will play an increasingly key role in accelerating solutions for sustainable development. Our SDG Innovation Loan will enable us to test bed fresh innovations that will exponentially enhance the way we build as well as raise the quality and performance of our buildings.” DBS has been at the forefront of sustainable finance in Asia. Over the past two years, it has provided around S$6.9 billion in sustainable financing to customers who want to go the extra mile to adopt more resource-efficient operations and towards green industries such as green real estate development and renewable energy. This amount includes green loans, ESG-linked loans and renewable projects financing. DBS was the sole bookrunner for CDL’s green bond in 2017. In addition, DBS provided a S$400 million green loan to CDL in April 2019 and was the Advisor for the loan. Mr Chew Chong Lim, Managing Director & Global Head of Real Estate, Institutional Banking, DBS Bank , said, “DBS is privileged to have supported a leading global real estate company like CDL since the start of their sustainable financing journey through issuing green bonds and green loans. This latest SDG Innovation Loan is an extension of our commitment to not only provide financial solutions that meet the changing demands of businesses but to advance SDGs to generate long-term value. We believe that partnerships like these can strengthen collective efforts to address increasingly complex sustainability challenges in new and different ways.” Ar Tai Lee Siang, Executive Director, BuildSG, Building and Construction Authority , said, “Transformation in Built Environment sector requires the effort of every individual, as well as leadership from across the value chain to motivate and drive change. The green financing initiative is a commendable effort given the increasing need to build more environmentally friendly buildings and infrastructure to mitigate the impact of climate change. We hope to see more of such collaborations between the financial institutions and built environment firms, to help spur the development of advanced and innovative solutions for green buildings.” Mr Nicholas Gandolfo, Associate Director of Client Relations, Sustainalytics , said, “The number of sustainable bonds and loans has increased significantly over the last few years, which has led to the rapid expansion of the sustainable finance market globally. CDL has played a meaningful role in growing the market through its green bonds and loans, and we are excited to see the company bring to market an SDG Innovation Loan that supports several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.” Sustainalytics is a leading external reviewer in sustainable finance and was the second party opinion provider for CDL’s green bond and green loans. As part of its sustainability blueprint CDL Future Value 2030, CDL has committed to achieve an average of two innovations or new technology adoptions per year by 2030. Over the years, CDL championed innovation for its various developments. In the early 2000s, CDL pioneered the use of Prefabricated Bathroom Units (PBUs) which improved construction productivity by up to 80% and reduced construction waste while enhancing water tightness of the bathrooms. Since 2014, PBUs have been mandatory for all non-landed residential Government Land Sales sites. CDL also pioneered the use of drywalls as they provide better quality finishes and are easier to install, improving productivity over the conventional brickwall system. Today, drywalls are a norm for the industry. As an early adopter of prefabrication technology, CDL was the first in Singapore to adopt the advanced Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) technology to build the CDL Green Gallery at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 2013. The entire Gallery was assembled in less than 24 hours using PPVC. Following its successful PPVC application for the CDL Green Gallery, CDL became the first developer in Asia to adopt the concrete PPVC method for a large-scale residential development, The Brownstone Executive Condominium (EC) in Sembawang, in 2014. This enabled CDL to achieve over 40% increase in construction productivity compared with conventional construction methods as well as enhanced on-site safety and waste reduction (see Annex A for more information). The use of PPVC is now an industry benchmark for construction productivity. [1] For example, these may include new ideas or processes to create better solutions for achieving sustainability targets, such as improved energy efficiency or reduced carbon emissions etc. The objective is to accelerate innovative solutions that positively impact the SDGs. [2] Examples include experts from National University of Singapore’s School of Design & Environment and the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore.

In PPVC, building modules complete with finishes, fixtures and fittings are manufactured off-site in factories before being transported to the site for installation in a ‘Lego-like’ manner. Key facts of The Brownstone EC Site area: Approximately 28,562.5 square metres / 307,447 square feet Development layout: Eight 10- to 12-storey blocks Number of apartments: 638 Configuration: Two- to four-bedroom units and five-bedroom penthouse units Key benefits of PPVC Productivity increase of over 40% Stringent quality control as modules are fabricated in controlled factory conditions Enhanced worksite safety as fewer workers are required on-site Improved worksite cleanliness as less construction debris is generated [END] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS introduces first-of-its-kind portfolio solution for beginner investors,02 Sep 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_introduces_first_of_its_kind_portfolio_solution_for_beginner_investors, Singapore ,"- Investors in Singapore can now sign up for early access to DBS digiPortfolio ( http://go.dbs.com/sg-digiportfolio or http://go.posb.com.sg/digiportfolio ), a hybrid human-robo investment solution developed by DBS Bank. The one-stop portfolio solution combines the expertise of DBS’ Wealth Management investment strategists with the efficiencies of robo technology. DBS is the only bank in Singapore to provide an inhouse robo investment solution, and the proposition also makes available a portfolio of SGX-listed ETFs to investors for the first time. The portfolio can be purchased by customers with no prior investment experience. With a minimum investment sum of SGD 1,000 or USD 1,000, DBS digiPortfolio gives investors instant access to a collection of four to seven Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)  representing between 200 and 13,000 holdings in a single transaction. A flat annual management fee of 0.75% is charged in return for the portfolio construction, monitoring and rebalancing services. The use of robo technology allows the bank to drive speed, scale and efficiencies for investors at lowered costs – there are no further sales charges, platform fees or transaction fees. Finally, investors are not subjected to a lock-in investing period, though they are encouraged to take a long-term approach with their investments. Leveraging the bank’s Wealth Management investment expertise, the portfolios offered in DBS digPortfolio are constructed with carefully selected ETFs and are reviewed quarterly. Rebalancing is initiated when necessary to ensure the portfolios remain resilient to market volatility, provide optimal returns, and remain aligned to the DBS Chief Investment Office’s views. “DBS digiPortfolio is part of a holistic view we take towards financial planning and personal investing. Our broader goal is to provide customers with the right tools and knowledge that will allow them to achieve all of their life goals,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank. “With DBS digiPortfolio, we lowered the barriers to personal investing by creating a portfolio accessible to all customers, and that is watched over by our experienced investment specialists and adjusted to remain optimal in changing market conditions. This gives investors a simple way to get invested safely and securely with us.” Said Chan Kum Kong, Head of Analysis and Research, SGX, “We applaud DBS for stepping up to provide an accessible and low-risk investment solution for Singapore retail investors, which includes SGX-listed ETFs. Investors can instantly gain access to a diversified portfolio that provides exposure to various stock markets and asset classes – all with a low initial investment amount. DBS’ solution presents investors a simple way to kick start their investing journey.” The bank is introducing DBS digiPortfolio to retail customers as part of its commitment to democratising access to financial expertise. With robo technology, DBS is able to provide specialised services and expertise traditionally limited to private banking customers to its retail clients. Its first-phase launch in March this year to wealth customers was met with strong response, and the solution proved to be highly effective in motivating customers to start on or resume their investment journey: 40% of DBS digiPortfolio wealth customers had not made an investment-related decision in the past 12 months. Investors will be able to choose from two portfolio options when DBS digiPortfolio is launched on the bank’s online banking platform: Asia Portfolio With a minimum investment sum of SGD 1,000, investors can enjoy instant access to the Asia Portfolio, which comprises SGX-listed ETFs that provide the investor with Singapore, China and India exposure. The portfolio is made up of ‘Excluded Investment Products  (EIP)’, which makes it accessible to all customers regardless of investment experience, thus significantly lowering the barriers to entry to investing. Global Portfolio For USD 1,000, investors can invest in the Global Portfolio, which consists of UK-listed ETFs providing global exposure. For those seeking global diversification in their investment portfolio, the Global Portfolio provides hyper-diversification for robust risk management, as well as exposure to the U.S., Europe, and Asia (ex-Japan). Each portfolio is available at varying risk levels: from “Slow n steady”, “Comfy cruisin’” to “Fast n furious”. This allows investors to opt for the risk level that best suits their personal risk tolerance, financial situation and investment goals. The early access sign-up for DBS digiPortfolio will open on 2 September and close on 30 September . Customers who have indicated their interest to invest will receive a notification once they receive access to DBS digiPortfolio. For more information, please visit ( http://go.dbs.com/sg-digiportfolio or http://go.posb.com.sg/digiportfolio ). 1 – ETFs are investment funds that aim to track the returns of a stock or commodity index. They offer investors several benefits, such as exposure to an index without having to invest in all its component stocks, and dividend pay-outs that come with the stocks held within the funds. 2 – Excluded Investment Products (EIPs) are investment products which have terms and features that are generally understood by retail investors, and the classification of an EIP is determined by its complexity, and not its risk level. 3 – Closing date may be subject to change.

Family offices gain ground in Asia with growing wealth and focus on successful intergenerational planning,30 Aug 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/family_offices_gain_ground_in_asia_with_growing_wealth_and_focus_on_successful_intergenerational_planning, Singapore ,"- Family offices are gaining popularity in Asia, which is now home to more than a quarter of the world’s billionaires. The explosive growth of wealth is opening doors to vast investment opportunities for these Asian families. Yet, they face economic, financial and regulatory risks, as well as the impact of the digital economy as technology brings new opportunities whilst challenging business conventions and dynamics. Further, the desire to preserve family legacy is strong as the founding patriarchs and matriarchs advance in age and expect to pass on wealth in the coming decade. These are the main reasons driving wealthy families to set up family offices in Asia’s financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong, finds a new report by DBS Private Bank and Ernst & Young Solutions LLP, The Asian Family Office: Key to Intergeneration Planning. Mr. Desmond Teo, EY Asia-Pacific Financial Services Growth Markets Leader says: “As the founding patriarch or matriarch hands over the reins to the next generation, more of the future generation are seeking to institutionalise the family office, hiring professionals with experience in the financial sector and putting in place sophisticated disciplined investment mandates. Further, the next generation may have a preference to forge their own future by pursuing new areas, rather than carrying on the established family business. Wealthy families are seeing family offices as a means to preserve the family legacy – be it the core business or the family name – as well as keep the family together and aligned.” Mr. Ian Burgess, EY Asia-Pacific Family Enterprise Leader adds: “The need to increase the professionalism in managing the family’s affairs and creating a family office, with employees dedicated to the various tasks, is a natural step for Asia’s high wealth family groups. As families mature, the focus usually shifts beyond the conventional pursuit of capital growth to include philanthropy, other social causes or special interests. Laying down the foundation of continual education of the current and future generations on the family’s legacy, values, and financial management, is also an increasingly important aspect of a family office in helping to strengthen the family for the future and minimise intergenerational conflicts.” This often is a complex, multi-faceted process and navigating it effectively requires quality professional advisory, strong market knowledge and a keen understanding of the family’s unique objectives. To this end, DBS has established a dedicated family office unit to work closely with clients and help address their needs. Mr. Lee Woon Shiu, Regional Head of Wealth Planning, Family Office and Insurance Solutions at DBS Private Bank says: “The concept of setting up professional family offices is still in its infancy in Asia, but the need is growing fast as wealth starts to change hands. With our reputation as Asia’s safest bank, as well as decades of heritage and extensive expertise in helping to create and manage our clients’ wealth, DBS stands well-placed to partner them on this journey. Through our robust ecosystem of best-of-breed internal and external advisors, our aim is to ensure clients have access to all the support and resources they need at every stage of their life cycle to effectively manage, protect and grow their assets for generations to come.” Increased scrutiny on cross-jurisdictional transparency of financial assets a potential risk The report highlights the implications of the increasing focus on cross-jurisdictional transparency of financial assets for wealth management. International cooperation on tax compliance and information sharing has been a critical development. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which requires participating jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. CRS brings a number of new challenges for family offices. For example, it requires due diligence, registration and reporting. CRS implementation and ongoing compliance will need to be effective in meeting the requisite reporting requirements, while balanced against managing the costs. Additionally, with the sharing of information on certain entities and individuals as part of CRS, families will need to embrace the new norm of transparency while balancing the family’s needs for privacy and security. For many Asian families, a fully operational family office will be a key component for successful intergeneration planning. Families embarking on this journey should: Take stock of where their activities are to be carried out practicably, and align their wealth planning structure Accept that transparency across jurisdictions is the new norm, and work to understand what it entails and the compliance that comes along Have a holistic management of the sharing or exchanging of financial information across various sources Consider the sustainability of the structure, not just in the next decade, but across generations The report was launched today at an exclusive client event by DBS Private Bank, Charting the Future of Asian Families. The inaugural event brings together the Monetary Authority of Singapore and industry experts from DBS Private Bank, Ernst & Young Solutions LLP and International Planning Group to share insights on key trends and issues faced by Asian families and how they can plan ahead for these challenges.

DBS named Singapore’s most valuable brand for seventh consecutive year,31 Jul 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_Singapores_most_valuable_brand_for_seventh_consecutive_year, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank has been named Singapore’s Most Valuable Brand for the seventh year in a row, with its brand value rising 39% to USD 9.03 billion, according to Brand Finance’s 2019 “Top 100 Singapore Brands” report. The bank’s brand rating was also upgraded to AAA, from AAA- in 2018, making it one of just five brands in the country to receive the triple-A rating. Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, DBS Bank said, “Holding the title of Singapore’s Most Valuable Brand for seven years running is an honour and a privilege. This distinction adds to our recent recognition as the first bank in the world to concurrently hold three of the most prestigious global best bank awards at the same time. Our accolades speak to the focus we have placed on reimagining banking, while also inspiring us to look beyond our role as a bank, driving change to ensure a sustainable future and to create a better world.” Earlier this month, DBS was named ‘World’s Best Bank’ by leading global financial publication Euromoney in its 2019 Awards for Excellence. The bank also won Global Finance’s ‘Best Bank in the World’ and The Banker’s ‘Bank of the Year – Global’ in August and November 2018, respectively, making it the first bank in the world to concurrently hold all three titles. This year, DBS was also ranked ASEAN’s most valuable brand for the seventh consecutive year [1] . Samir Dixit, Managing Director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific said, ““New technological developments will have perhaps the fastest application opportunities for the services sector and within that the banks. Retail revenues will be under constant pressure and present a threat to banks going forward, and it will become a way of doing business. DBS has a head start over others in the region due to their early focus on digital platforms and design thinking, putting them in good stead to address new challenges that may arise in the coming years.” London-based Brand Finance is an independent brand strategy and valuation consultancy. The Singapore Top 100 Brands report is published annually and incorporates data from all listed companies. Each brand is accorded a brand rating: a benchmarking study of the strength, risk and future potential of a brand relative to its competitor set; and a brand value, which is a summary measure of the financial strength of the brand.

DBS survey finds more CFOs and corporate treasurers in APAC leading digital transformation,25 Jul 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_survey_finds_more_CFOs_and_corporate_treasurers_in__APAC_leading_digital_transformation, Singapore ,"- The inaugural Digital Treasury Index [1] commissioned by DBS Bank revealed that Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and corporate treasurers (29.5%) see themselves as increasingly responsible for pushing the agenda of their companies’ digital strategy. This compares with 43.6% of respondents who saw it as the responsibility of their technology colleagues. Surprisingly, only 11.3% of respondents across APAC said that driving digital transformation was the responsibility of their CEOs. A large number of the CFO and corporate treasurer respondents (44.1%) also noted that along with leading the agenda they are partnering heavily with their business units to drive digital transformation execution. In terms of digital readiness, the survey also showed that seven in 10 companies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region risk being left behind by a lack of digital strategy and execution plan. Singapore companies fared better with 41% having a digital transformation strategy in place. Australian businesses appeared to be the least mature of the developed markets surveyed with under 10% having a clearly defined digital strategy. John Laurens, Group Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS, said that digital transformation is pervasive and disrupting industries across the globe. “More and more, companies have come to understand that digital transformation involves a complete transformation across their organisation – from front-end sales engagement to back-end operations. And this requires the involvement of every part of the company’s organisation. We are seeing more and more CFOs and Treasurers being called upon to drive this change because they have broad oversight and in-depth understanding of key business drivers and organisational challenges.” Speed of change - biggest risk to digital adoption  CFOs and corporate treasurers said that the top three risks to digital adoption were (1) the speed of change and complexity of the enabling technologies (86.4%), (2) execution challenges and delivery of outcomes (78.8%) and (3) the availability of talent to help execute digital transformation efforts (67.6%). Laurens said companies are increasingly seeking out banks’ advice on the suitability and safety of new technologies for business use. “It is interesting to see CFOs and treasurers deal with some of the new Fintech risks emerging as a result of the digital push by business leading to reliance on banks to help mitigate such risks. What’s more, they are demanding new ways to connect to banks such as through APIs (application programming interfaces) where the connection is both direct and instantaneous.” The increasing adoption of APIs for integration with banks and third parties was a particular highlight in the Index, with 32.3% of CFOs and Treasurers now using APIs to connect with banks and other third parties, and set to grow to 40% over the next 12 months. “It’s all about APIs for us; they are quick to deploy and tend not to require major rework around our ERP platforms. We are finding the approach especially useful as well across our supply chain partners,” says a large Hong Kong based exporter. When addressing the greatest advantages they see from digital transformation, CFOs and corporate treasurers ranked reducing costs and improving efficiencies as a top ROI (1.93 [2] ) outcome. However, improved customer experience (2.03) and lower market engagement barriers (2.11) followed very closely, illustrating the growing realisation that digital transformation is critical to driving competitive advantage and future revenue generation for their businesses. [1] The survey conducted by East & Partners Asia interviewed 1,304 chief financial officers (CFO) and corporate treasurers from an even mix of middle market companies (USD100m to USD1bn revenue equivalent) and corporations (USD1bn-plus revenue equivalent) in 13 markets – Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

The interest rate of the export financing sustainability-linked loan will be reduced for each shipment of raw material that has an FSC certification, documenting that the raw material is responsibly sourced. STI is also a FSC-certified company focused on responsible sourcing, manufacturing and exporting of sustainable-certified products.

Hidayat Ang, Director, PT Sumatera Timberindo Industry said that high quality products that are processed in a responsible and sustainable manner is becoming the way forward. “For manufacturers such as us, ESG certification is important as it boils down to our core value of operating our business sustainably and responsibly. Our products are handled responsibly at every stage of production – from forest to shelf. With customers becoming more eco-conscious, they want to be assured that the products and services they procure adhere to traditional and civil rights and do not threaten high conservation value (HCV) areas.” As a satisfied and active user of DBS’ corporate digital banking solutions, he added that STI’s synergies with DBS in advancing sustainability not only support the company’s long-term growth but also empower people and the local community to do good for the environment. Rudy Tandjung, Director, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, said that the bank is delighted to support companies in moving their sustainability agenda forward, as more of them are seeking business growth while considering ESG factors. “DBS has been providing banking services to STI since 2006. This deal demonstrates how we as a purpose-driven bank, are able to support customers through their journey to remain at the forefront of their industries even with changing expectations of stakeholders. It is testament to our commitment to addressing social and environmental concerns through our lending activities and business practices. We want to help businesses leave a positive impact for the future.” Apart from the latest export financing sustainability-linked loan, DBS also provides bancassurance keyman insurance to STI.

DBS named ‘World’s Best Bank’ by Euromoney magazine | 繁體 | Bahasa,11 Jul 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_Worlds_Best_Bank_by_Euromoney_magazine," Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Regional ","- In a feat unmatched by other banks globally, DBS has become the first bank to concurrently hold three global best bank awards. This was achieved after DBS was named “World’s Best Bank” by leading global financial publication Euromoney in its 2019 Awards for Excellence. It follows the bank’s wins of Global Finance’s “Best Bank in the World” in August 2018 and The Banker’s “Bank of the Year – Global” in November 2018. This is the first time an Asian-headquartered bank has been named “World’s Best Bank” by Euromoney since the award was launched in 1993. Past winners included Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citi and UBS. DBS was also named Asia’s Best Bank and Singapore’s Best Bank in this year’s Awards for Excellence. Clive Horwood, Editor of Euromoney, said, “DBS was chosen for our awards because it represents what we believe a bank should look like today. No other institution has worked so hard to embrace and lead digital disruption, and while some banks demonstrate their technological prowess with impressive apps, DBS does so by embedding digital innovation into everything it does – with a tangible positive impact on the bottom line. It has achieved this with a clear-sighted focus on sustainability that positions it well for the years ahead.” Piyush Gupta, DBS CEO, said, “We are honoured to be recognised by Euromoney as the World’s Best Bank. With this award, we are now the first bank ever to concurrently hold three of the most prestigious global best bank honours. This achievement underlines widespread recognition for our leadership in defining the future of banking, and our commitment to deliver a purpose beyond banking to create a more sustainable future.” DBS’ digital transformation efforts – widely recognised as one of the most comprehensive for a bank – continue to reap results.

"DBS launches Singapore's first one-stop integrated travel marketplace with Singapore Airlines, Expedia Partner Solutions and Chubb",09 Jul 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_Singapores_first_one_stop_integrated_travel_marketplace_with_Singapore_Airlines_Expedia_Partner_Solutions_and_Chubb, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced the beta launch of DBS Travel Marketplace ( https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/marketplace/travel ), Singapore's first one-stop integrated travel marketplace, in partnership with Singapore Airlines (SIA), Expedia Partner Solutions (EPS) and Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited. The one-stop solution, made possible by integrating Application Programming Interface (API) technology, offers travellers competitive flight fares, hotel rates and free travel insurance coverage to more than 25,000 holiday destinations worldwide. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of DBS Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), “With outbound leisure travel trips by Singaporean residents estimated to reach 11.8 million trips by 2020, we wanted to create a hassle-free, one-stop travel solution for frequent travellers. Many spend a significant amount of their time on pre-vacation planning on multiple sites poring over multi-city connecting flights, researching accommodation options, and making sure they have adequate travel insurance. By working with leading partners from the airline, hospitality and insurances spaces, DBS Travel Marketplace can effectively streamline this process. We aim to provide a stress-free, one-stop-shop experience that comprehensively caters to travellers’ needs – from the moment they plan their trip till after they return home.” DBS Travel Marketplace marks DBS’ fourth such integrated digital marketplace, and its first payments-enabled one. The bank believes that by creating meaningful ecosystem partnerships (collaborating and innovating together with partners) through its marketplace platform, customers will benefit from a seamless, fuss-free experience bringing together the best of travel and banking solutions. For example, a customer who logs in with his DBS/POSB online banking credentials and consents to sharing his data will have his personal and payment details automatically pre-filled in his travel booking. Customers can choose to offset the cost of their travel bookings with their DBS Points or POSB Daily$ For every booking made on the DBS Travel Marketplace, every traveller named in the party will receive complimentary travel insurance, underwritten by Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited, which covers them for four major travel inconveniences: journey cancellation; travel delay; baggage delay; accidental death and disablement. In addition, DBS/POSB customers can also choose to offset the cost of their travel bookings with their DBS Points or POSB Daily$. The beta launch of DBS Travel Marketplace follows a recently signed memorandum of understanding between DBS and SIA to enhance digital capabilities across various digital platforms. DBS is the first bank which SIA has connected with via API technology for direct flight ticket sales. Over the next few months, DBS and SIA will enable customers to manage their flight bookings, as well as introduce KrisShop merchandising capabilities, on DBS Travel Marketplace. The bank is also the first bank in APAC which EPS has connected with via their API technology, Rapid, for direct hotel bookings. This will expand opportunities for travellers by providing immediate access to competitive hotel deals, including Expedia Group’s offering of more than 500,000 accommodations across over 25,000 destinations worldwide. DBS intends to tie up with more travel ecosystem partners to gradually introduce a slew of updates that will expand its flight and accommodation inventories, enable more payment options, and provide a travel shopping experience, among others. DBS’ Car, Property and Electricity Marketplaces  DBS is uniquely well-placed in the marketplaces space as it banks most of Singapore. The bank has more than five million retail customers, and banks more than one in two SMEs. This enables DBS to build marketplaces with robust ecosystems in partnership with global companies, SMEs and with the aid of consumer insights. In addition, DBS’ sites are among the most visited in Singapore, which allows the bank to leverage its popular online channels to attract customers to relevant marketplaces for their lifestyle needs. Since its launch as Singapore’s largest direct seller-to-buyer car marketplace, DBS Car Marketplace has attracted more than 550,000 unique visits. DBS Property Marketplace has in turn generated more than SGD 300 million in home loan requests within the first 12 months. Customers can choose from more than 30 price plans offered by seven alternative electricity retailers on DBS Electricity Marketplace, which has registered more than 300,000 unique visits to date.  Appendix – Partner Quotes Singapore Airlines  “DBS is the first bank partner we are connecting to our booking API, giving DBS customers the ability to book Singapore Airlines flights directly from the Travel Marketplace platform. This enhancement is part of SIA’s broader drive to expand distribution into new digital ecosystems, to be present where customers are, thus improving their convenience and experience,” said Singapore Airlines Senior Vice President Sales and Marketing, Mr Campbell Wilson. Expedia Partner Solutions “EPS unlocks the power of Expedia Group for our partners and we are excited to work with DBS across such an important region as Asia. At EPS we are laser focused on developing the latest technology to help our partners thrive as digital leaders. Through access to our global supply of accommodations, DBS can provide competitive rates on hotel stays and offer customers a seamless travel booking experience,” said Chris Williams, Regional Vice President, Expedia Partner Solutions, APAC. Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited “In biennial travel surveys conducted in Singapore by Chubb, respondents cited being injured when travelling as their top worry, while flight delays were the most common travel hardship experienced. In partnership with DBS, Chubb aims to provide DBS/POSB Cardmembers with complimentary travel protection which addresses these concerns with coverage for personal accident and travel inconveniences to enhance the overall travel experience.” said Mr. Scott Simpson, Country President for Chubb in Singapore.

"DBS debuts second season of SPARKS, an award-winning mini-series, with focus on sustainability",28 Jun 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_debuts_second_season_of_SPARKS_an_award_winning_mini_series_with_focus_on_sustainability, Singapore ,"- In line with its commitment to advancing the sustainability agenda as a purpose-driven bank, DBS Bank today debuted the second season of Sparks, an award-winning mini-series. Themed “Everyday Heroes for a Better World” and inspired by true stories, the first three episodes of this new season follow a group of dynamic DBS bankers as they partner with the community to address some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of the day. These include plastic pollution, food waste as well as social inequality. The episodes are inspired by the stories of three social enterprises (SEs), Evoware from Indonesia, Bettr Barista from Singapore and Eco-Greenergy from Hong Kong, which are supported by the DBS Foundation. The DBS Foundation was set up five years ago to champion social entrepreneurship and has since nurtured over 300 SEs around the region. Evoware was founded to address the global plastic waste problem by providing an eco-friendly, biodegradable and even edible packaging solution made from seaweed. Bettr Barista empowers marginalised individuals through jobs training in coffee brewing so they can be self-sufficient. As food waste becomes a burgeoning issue in developed societies, Eco-Greenergy turns coffee grounds into innovative products such as compostable cutlery, therefore upcycling food waste. Through Sparks Season Two, DBS hopes to spark conversations and galvanise change around key sustainability challenges such as: • Plastic pollution: Asia is home to eight of the world’s top 10 plastic waste polluting countries. It is estimated that five Asian countries alone – China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam – account for 60% of all plastics dumped into the ocean. In Singapore, the consumption of single-use plastics continues to be a particularly pressing issue. According to the Singapore Environment Council, Singaporeans use at least 1.76 billion plastic items a year, of which less than 20% is recycled. • Inequality: Despite economic development, issues of social and gender inequality remain. OECD work shows that the accumulation of disadvantages for certain income groups can have detrimental effects on the prosperity and well-being of all. • Food waste: USD 1 trillion of food is wasted globally each year, and Asia contributes to 50% of this. In Singapore, 2.5 kg of food is thrown away by an average Singapore home each week. At the same time, through the episodes, the bank seeks to pay tribute to everyday heroes whether individuals, businesses or members of Team DBS, who are passionately and resiliently stepping out to make a difference. Karen Ngui, Head of DBS Group Strategic Marketing & Communications and Board Member of DBS Foundation said: “As a purpose-driven bank that’s deeply rooted in the heart of Singapore and the region, we believe we have a central role to play in creating a sustainable future that goes beyond banking. We are acutely aware that such a huge endeavour requires us to join hands with businesses, communities and the public. Fundamentally, we also believe that there is an everyday hero in each and every one of us, and together, we can all drive change – in big and small ways – for a better world.” Over the years, DBS has been focused on advancing the sustainability agenda, through responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating social impact. It was the first bank in Southeast Asia to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the first Singapore bank to be named as a constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index. DBS has also been included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the last two years. In 2018, the bank provided sustainable financing amounting to more than SGD 2.4 billion. Recently, the bank signed Singapore’s first sustainability linked loan for an SME with Chew’s Agriculture, a leading egg producer in Singapore. DBS is moving towards utilising 100% renewable energy for its entire Singapore operations by 2030 and has partnered the Singapore Management University to launch Singapore’s first sustainability major. On the social impact front, the DBS Foundation has awarded about SGD 5 million in grants to SEs across the region. These SEs have deployed social innovations in areas such as healthcare, social inclusion, environment protection, waste management, food sustainability, as well as employment and income generation for the marginalised. In 2017, DBS was also the official banking partner and sole placement agent for the Women’s Livelihood Bond, the world’s first social sustainability bond to be listed on a stock exchange. For its sustainability efforts, DBS was conferred the Singapore Apex Corporate Sustainability Award for Sustainable Business, Sustainable Business Awards Singapore for Best Flagship Initiative and Champion of Good 2018 by Company of Good. Since its 2016 debut, the 10 episodes of the first season of Sparks have garnered more than 250 million views and over 24 million digital engagements across the region. It has also won a number of global marketing accolades. These include the Gold Award in Digital Marketing at the global Efma-Accenture 2017 Distribution & Marketing Innovation Awards and Silver in the prestigious Shorty Awards 2018. Most recently, it was also named winner in the Video Marketing category, Corporate division, in the Conference Board’s Excellence in Marketing and Communications Awards 2019. Cast members in Sparks Season Two include industry veterans and rising stars such as Adrian Pang, Tan Kheng Hua, Jae Liew, Aanchal Wadhwani, Arifin Putra, Chen Yi Xin, Chew Kin Wah, Darryl Yong, Jamie Xia, Terrance Tan and Thomas Pang.

"DBS, GOJEK expand payment services partnership in Singapore",13 Jun 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/dbs_gojek_expand_payment_services," Regional, Singapore ","- In a move to provide more convenient payment options to users, DBS Bank and GOJEK today announced that consumers in Singapore can now pay for their GOJEK rides with DBS PayLah!. GOJEK customers will be able to add DBS PayLah! as a preferred payment method for GOJEK rides after a one-time authorisation and set-up. This feature has been made available in the GOJEK app for both iOS and Android users in Singapore. According to GOJEK, about 35% of its daily ride-hailing transactions are paid for in cash. This presents an opportunity for DBS and GOJEK to encourage users – who may not own a debit or credit card and so need an alternative to cash payments – to adopt digital payments to enjoy a more convenient and seamless payment experience. DBS PayLah! is Singapore’s most popular mobile wallet. Today, over one million users are able to use DBS PayLah! at some 80,000 merchants in Singapore. Consumers can also look forward to GOJEK’s integration within DBS PayLah! in the next few months. “As GOJEK’s preferred payment partner in Singapore, we are pleased to expand our payments services partnership to provide a full suite of easy and seamless options for consumers to travel and pay as they prefer,” said Shee Tse Koon, Singapore Country Head, DBS Bank. “DBS and GOJEK are two companies that share the same vision of providing the best possible experience for our customers, and in doing so, we are laser-focused on creating long-term value and building a sustainable future.” Lien Choong Luen, General Manager of GOJEK Singapore, added: “We value our partners and are always finding new ways to work with them to bring new benefits to our users. Through integrating DBS PayLah! in the GOJEK app, our riders will have greater flexibility to choose their preferred payment methods, which allows for a more seamless travel and payment experience with every ride. This is the latest benefit that we are bringing to our users in partnership with DBS – and will not be the last. We will continue to collaborate to find innovative ways to deliver value to our customers.” To that end, GOJEK has also partnered DBS in Singapore on: Creating better flexibility and a better experience for driver-partners : GOJEK’s driver-partners can make unlimited real-time withdrawals of their earnings from their GOJEK wallets. Payouts are deposited directly into their bank accounts. This is made possible by DBS IDEAL RAPID – a straight-through API solution that has been integrated into GOJEK’s driver payment process to enable GOJEK to provide real-time payment services for its drivers. In recognition of this payment milestone, GOJEK and DBS were awarded “Best Payments and Collections Solution” at The Asset’s Asian Awards 2019. Supporting social enterprises and beneficiaries at the DBS Marina Regatta : GOJEK came forward in support of DB Hearts, a ground-up movement made up of volunteers who seek to make communities more inclusive through dragon boating. DB Hearts’ volunteers and their fellow paddlers, who include participants with special needs and from marginalised communities, enjoyed subsidised GOJEK rides to and from this year’s DBS Marina Regatta – where they took part in the Community Race event and participated in Singapore’s largest eco-maze. Shee added, “Following the success of DBS and GOJEK’s partnership in Singapore, where GOJEK recently celebrated their 10 million-trip milestone, we have also entered the next phase of our partnership in Indonesia. Indonesia is a key growth market for DBS, and is where GOJEK has established itself as an innovation leader by becoming a part of Indonesians’ everyday lives.” DBS and GOJEK are exploring collaboration opportunities in Indonesia, such as cross-marketing initiatives, with further details to be announced in due course. Indonesia is where GOJEK is headquartered in, and where DBS provides a full range of services in consumer, SME and corporate banking across 13 major cities, and has more than 460,000 digibank customers to date.

DBS helps SMEs in the retail and F&B sectors reduce cost of managing cash and increase customer convenience,04 Jun 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_helps_SMEs_in_the_retail_and_Famp_B_sectors_reduce_cost_of_managing_cash_and_increase_customer_convenience, Singapore ,"- Small and Medium sized enterprises (SMEs) which make up the backbone of Singapore’s economy are increasingly turning to digital transactions to collect money from their customers. DBS has seen a 70% increase in digital transactions from its SME customers and 25% increase in transaction value since the bank launched DBS MAX [1] , Singapore’s first mobile-based QR payment collection solution in Singapore four months ago. Adoption of DBS MAX has been steadily expanding with close to 2,000 merchants and 3,000 over outlets across Singapore, enjoying the ease and convenience of this “plug and play” digital payments collection solution. DBS MAX has been most popular among the bank’s SME customers in the F&B and retail sectors for its flexibility. They can sign up for DBS MAX instantly and collections at cashiers or outlets can be enabled and maintained on the DBS IDEAL [2] website. In addition to store-front collections, DBS MAX is also increasingly replacing cash in B2B and B2C last mile deliveries. Francis Looi, CEO of Polar Puffs & Cakes Pte Ltd, said that the customers now are becoming more familiar with digital wallets and so he has had to keep up with the times. With DBS MAX, it has also been easier to balance the books at the end of the day and employees have also had less cash to deal with. “With DBS MAX, my staff are happier as there is less cash handling and fewer trips to the bank to deposit money and get the right denominations for change at our outlets island wide. As a result, the Polar team can now focus more on customer experience and think up new ideas for delicious cakes and pastries.” Bernardine Ho, General Manager of Retail, Planet Telecoms, added that DBS MAX brings more convenience to customers thus improving retail experience. “We have always believed that cashless payment is the way forward in order to remain relevant in an increasingly digital age, especially since we are at the forefront of the retail telecoms industry. DBS MAX will not only help us in our digitalisation efforts but will provide our customers with a better and more seamless retail experience.” For SMEs adopting digital forms of payment collection, DBS MAX eliminates the time and effort in managing and depositing cash in banks. In 2015, it was estimated that the cost of processing cash is about SGD2 billion a year, or 0.5% of Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product. This is the amount that businesses collectively, especially small businesses, can potentially save. Businesses have since recognised the ease and advantage of using DBS MAX and have embraced digital collections in a big way. In the first four months of 2019, overall cash transactions for SME customers using DBS MAX have significantly decreased by about half. This co-relates to the over four in five Singaporeans [3] who are already using some form of e-payment, as digitalisation brings about more ease and convenience. This trend is set to continue with the increase in digital payments collections solutions targeted directly at SMEs such as DBS MAX. Jasmin Ng, Group Head of Cash Product Management at DBS Bank, said, “Cashflow is the lifeblood of SMEs. One of the key challenges for SMEs is the ability to achieve sufficient liquidity while balancing expenses. As a bank, we are constantly looking at how we can innovate to help SMEs optimise their working capital, while streamlining their collections and payables process. DBS MAX has proven to be successful as DBS has enabled SMEs to plug into the digital ecosystem in a simple, secure and straightforward manner and resolves current pain points of cash and cheques handling.” Ng added that DBS is continually enhancing DBS MAX to meet the evolving needs and requests from customers. DBS MAX can soon be integrated into customers’ own mobile app, website or any other user interfaces with the full suite of DBS MAX functionality such as: instant notifications, consolidated credit and refunds and reconciliation reports. “This solution will meet the needs of eCommerce customers in particular, as it will provide additional online or in app payment solutions to provide payers flexibility to pay directly from bank accounts.” With its early success with SMEs in Singapore, DBS MAX has now been rolled out in Hong Kong and India. With continued decline of the physical wallet and as Asian consumers become more sophisticated, DBS expects that more than three in five retail SMEs will sign up for the DBS MAX solution in the next 12 months.

Chew’s Agriculture signs Singapore’s first SME sustainability-linked loan with DBS,29 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Chews_Agriculture_signs_Singapores_first_SME_sustainability_linked_loan_with_DBS, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced that Chew’s Agriculture, a leading egg producer in Singapore, has signed a 10-year, SGD 27 million sustainability-linked loan with the bank. This marks a milestone for sustainable development in Singapore – it is the nation’s first sustainability-linked loan for an SME. The loan was evaluated based on a series of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance metrics. Chew’s will use the loan for the construction of a new farm with larger cage-free facilities so that hens [1] which lay eggs on the farm will continue to be housed in the most optimum conditions, such as larger litter areas and elevated perches. Under the terms of the loan, Chew’s will enjoy lower interest rates if it meets Humane Farm Animal Care (HFAC) standards [2] such as providing livestock access to wholesome and nutritious feed, appropriate environmental design, caring and responsible planning and management of livestock, and skilled, knowledgeable conscientious animal care, factors which contribute to more nutritious eggs. As a supplier of 500,000 eggs a day, where 95% of eggs produced is distributed in Singapore, Chew’s is committed to renewing and securing the HFAC certification [3] . Mr Edvin Lim, director of Chew’s Agriculture, said that eggs are an economical and nutritious staple in most diets and consumers these days are becoming more health and eco-conscious. “As a result, the demand for nutritious eggs produced in the right environment has become even more important. By providing products that are responsibly produced and ethically-farmed, we can ensure that our business keeps up with the expectations of our diverse customer base. Through incorporating HFAC standards, we are not only ensuring the well-being of our layer hens but improving the quality of the eggs that they produce. It is a win-win solution that definitely sets a new benchmark for how we run our business.” Ms Joyce Tee, Head of SME Banking, DBS Group said that Chew’s is paving the way for SMEs to incorporate sustainable business practices into their daily operations. DBS expects sustainability-linked financing to increase in the SME sector especially since these financing options incentivise and reward companies to advance their sustainability agenda. “With growing awareness of the importance of sustainability, we continue to integrate responsible financing principles into our credit assessment processes and lending activities. We are so encouraged that companies such as Chew’s are building businesses that will leave a lasting impact for the future.” For DBS Bank’s sustainability-linked loans, corporates are evaluated based on an annual sustainability review report typically assessed by an external independent party, tracking the performance of corporates in terms of governance, environmental and social criteria. When the borrower meets or exceeds pre-determined ESG targets, the interest rate will then be reduced. Borrowers not only share their commitment to sustainability but are also entitled to a competitive interest rate. In 2018, DBS became the first bank in Southeast Asia and one of five Singapore-listed companies to be included in the DJSI Asia Pacific. The DJSI Asia Pacific serves as a valuable reference point for investors and companies and consists of businesses that have committed to corporate sustainability practices, and which seek to create long-term stakeholder value. [1] Layer chickens are a species of hens. They start laying eggs commercially from 18-19 weeks of age. [2] https://certifiedhumane.org/wp-content/uploads/Std14.Chickens.2A-4.pdf [3] Humane Farm Animal Care is a non-profit charity whose mission is to improve the lives of farm animals by providing viable, credible, duly monitored standards for humane food production and assuring consumers that certified products meet these standards. The Humane Farm Animal Care Standards have been developed to provide only approved standards for the rearing, handling, transport and slaughter of laying hens for use in the Certified Humane® programme.

DBS Bank and AU Optronics sign Taiwan’s first sustainability-linked loan,21 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_and_AU_Optronics_sign_Taiwans_first_sustainability_linked_loan," Taiwan, Singapore ","- DBS Bank Taipei Branch signed a three-year, NTD 2 billion (SGD 88 million) sustainability-linked loan with AU Optronics, marking a milestone for sustainable development in Taiwan. This is the first sustainability-linked loan in Taiwan and the first of its kind for an IT company in Asia Pacific. The loan was evaluated based on a series of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance metrics. DBS is partnering with customers to remain at the forefront of their industries, as sustainability considerations are gaining more attention globally. By launching Taiwan’s first sustainability-linked loan, which pegs the interest rate to sustainability performance targets, the bank hopes to encourage more customers to build businesses that will leave a positive impact for the future. AU Optronics has always been committed to supporting sustainable development. It has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for nine consecutive years. It is also on the MSCI World ESG Leaders Index and the FTSE4Good Index. In addition, it has been ranked among the top 5% in Taiwan Stock Exchange’s Corporate Governance evaluation. AUO has an excellent performance track record in diversified areas such as corporate governance, environmental sustainability, science education, culture preservation, social citizenship and inclusive workplace. Being the first to sign the sustainability-linked loan with DBS Bank Taipei Branch, AUO is cementing its commitment to adopting a sustainable approach to business operations and being a role model for Taiwanese companies in this area. Lim Him Chuan, General Manager of DBS Bank (Taiwan), said that there is a growing trend for corporates to adopt more sustainable practices in their business operations. While seeking business growth, they are also considering social, environmental and governance factors. In 2018, DBS Group inked four sustainability performance-linked loans amounting to over SGD 600 million, demonstrating the bank’s commitment to sustainability while offering financial innovation to customers. Tony Luo, Head of Institutional Banking Group at DBS Bank (Taiwan) said, “The core value of a sustainability-linked loan is to incentivise and reward corporations to advance their sustainability agenda.”  For DBS Bank’s sustainability-linked loans, corporates are evaluated based on an annual sustainability review report assessed by an external independent party, tracking the performance of corporates in terms of governance, environmental and social criteria. When the borrower meets or exceeds pre-determined ESG targets, the interest rate will then be reduced. Borrowers not only share their commitment to sustainability but are also entitled to a competitive interest rate. Luo further explained that unlike green loans which are used to exclusively finance or re-finance eligible green projects, capital from sustainability-linked loans can be used for general corporate purposes. This provides more flexibility to borrowers, and the impact goes beyond environmental aspects to cover comprehensive ESG developments of an organisation.  In 2018, DBS became the first bank in Southeast Asia and one of five Singapore-listed companies to be included in the DJSI Asia Pacific. The DJSI Asia Pacific serves as a valuable reference point for investors and companies and consists of businesses that have committed to corporate sustainability practices, and which seek to create long-term stakeholder value."

DBS enables digital payments for one in three Singapore pre-schools,16 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_enables_digital_payments_for_one_in_three_Singapore_pre_schools, Singapore ,"- Over 160,000 young parents in Singapore will soon be able to purchase uniforms, pay for field trips and sign up for extra-curricular classes for their pre-school children through a mobile payment platform gateway developed by DBS. DBS has partnered with EduTech company, LittleLives, to enhance their app-based pre-school management system with real-time payment features. The app is used by one in three pre-schools [1] in Singapore. The enhanced LittleLives app, which helps pre-school teachers update parents on their child’s development, was officially launched at the DBS Auditorium, with Minister for Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung as the Guest of Honour. In Singapore, the early childhood education sector is still dependent on cash despite school fees being paid via GIRO or Child Development Accounts (CDA). For example, when paying for excursions, school uniforms or learning resources, parents often make payments using cash or cheques and the school then makes arrangements to pay third-party vendors. With payment functions built into the LittleLives app, pre-school operators can save up to 40 manhours per month on administrative tasks such as payments reconciliation, allowing them more time to engage with parents and their children. This addresses a recent DBS survey that revealed that one in four SMEs are looking to develop their digital business capabilities to improve productivity. Eliminating these payment pain points is the first step in digitalising payments in the early childhood education sector, said Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank. “By partnering LittleLives, we hope to take the hassle out of payments so pre-school operators can better manage their cash flow. By building payments capabilities into the app, we have made banking invisible and seamless, so pre-school operators can channel their energy and resources back into building their business,” she said. The LittleLives app is used by over 750 pre-schools in Singapore. The app can now enable pre-schools to generate invoices and parents to make payments through PayNow and DBS PayLah!. Receipts will be generated automatically after payments are made. With access to real-time payment reports such as daily settlement and auto-reconciliation, pre-schools can better manage their finances more accurately and securely. Sun Ho, Founder of LittleLives, showing Chua Chai Yun, Principal of E-Bridge Pre-School (Bukit Panjang), how to use the LittleLives app “Many young parents are time-strapped and juggling multiple responsibilities at work and at home. By enabling parents to conduct payments on the go, quickly and safely, they have more time to nurture and care for their children,” said Sun Ho, founder of LittleLives. “Partnering a powerhouse like DBS will help us create a super app that will transform how pre-schools are managed. LittleLives can then create an amazing childhood education experience for both children and parents,” she said. Pre-schools, such as E-Bridge Preschool, have reaped the benefits of using the enhanced LittleLives app. “With the new payments and auto-reconciliation features, we’ve saved around five working days a month. We can use this time to better engage with parents and their children,” said Chua Chai Yun, Principal of E-Bridge Pre-School (Bukit Panjang). As a working mum juggling a full-time job, Eileen Yeo says the enhanced LittleLives app has saved her time and made her life easier.  Eileen Yeo is a 36-year-old mother of two young children, both of whom attend E-Bridge Pre-School (Bukit Panjang). As a working mother juggling a full-time job as a property agent while managing her family’s business, she appreciates the new payments feature on the LittleLives app. “The payment system is so easy to use, I don’t have to worry about issuing cheques or dealing with the embarrassment of making a late payment. It’s made my life easier, and I appreciate how I can manage my kids’ pre-school needs on the go,” she said. DBS and LittleLives have plans to roll out this payments gateway to other markets such as Brunei, Cambodia, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. This is made possible with DBS IDEAL RAPID [2] , an API-enabled solution, that allows the bank and its partners to scale their services quickly and seamlessly. [1] According to data.gov.sg, there are over 2,000 kindergartens and childcare centres. https://data.gov.sg/dataset/list-of-childcare-centres, https://data.gov.sg/dataset/list-of-kindergarten-services [2] DBS IDEAL RAPID is a solution by DBS, enabling its corporate customers to access banking services seamlessly and in real-time with the use of Application Programme Interface (API).

DBS Global Income Note raises over SGD 1 billion in three months,10 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Global_Income_Note_raises_over_SGD_1_billion_in_three_months, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced the successful introduction of the DBS Global Income Note (“the note”), which has raised over SGD 1 billion in three months following its launch in January 2019. As the hunt for yield continues to dominate in a lower-for-longer environment, the note presents a timely solution for income investors seeking capital preservation and a stable, consistent source of income. The open-ended structured note references the DBS Global Income Portfolio. The latter is a globally diversified and equally weighted portfolio of at least 100 mostly investment-grade bonds across geographies and sectors. Every month, the portfolio is rebalanced, and its average duration is adjusted using interest rate derivatives to manage portfolio interest rate risk in line with the DBS Chief Investment Office’s (CIO) target duration. In addition, all underlying bonds are monitored closely by DBS Group Research and DBS fixed income analysts on an ongoing basis. The DBS Global Income Note is designed to be a cornerstone of investors’ portfolios through the economic cycle. It has a current payout of around 4.25% per annum in USD, and provides high income visibility and transparency as it pays out coupons collected (less structuring fees and costs) to investors on a quarterly basis. It is also available in an SGD-hedged format. The minimum investment sum is USD 50,000 or SGD 100,000. In comparison, the minimum trade size for a single non-retail bond is SGD 250,000. Said Audra Seah, Head of Investment Advisory and Capital Markets, DBS Private Bank, “With the hunt for yield remaining a consistent theme amid falling interest rates, narrowing credit spreads and the inverted yield environment we’re seeing today, we believe the launch of the DBS Global Income Note is timely. Fully conceptualised, structured and managed in-house at DBS, the note effectively demonstrates how DBS’ ‘One Bank’ proposition is able to leverage expertise across the bank to deliver a unique income instrument.” The note is structured by DBS’ investment advisory and capital markets team, with the underlying portfolio of bonds selected based on DBS CIO’s investment guidance and target duration, and the credit research expertise of DBS Group Research and DBS fixed income analysts. “Demand for the DBS Global Income Note has been exceedingly strong, which speaks to the solid track record that we have established. We structured the DBS Global Income Note to address income investors’ need for greater stability and certainty by providing access to a highly diversified fixed income portfolio for a relatively small investment amount. In addition, by including only actively-monitored and mostly investment-grade bonds, we relieve investors of the need to keep close tabs on their portfolio, which would be challenging and time-consuming in today’s increasingly volatile environment.” The DBS Global Income Note is available to accredited investors from DBS Private Bank and DBS Treasures Private Client.

Bank DBS Establishes Joint Financing Cooperation with Home Credit | Bahasa,09 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Bank_DBS_Establishes_Joint_Financing_Cooperation_with_Home_Credit, Indonesia ,"- World Bank data (2017) show that more than 38% of Indonesia’s population of 250 million people or more than 95 million Indonesians have no access to banking products (unbanked population) and only 17% of the adult population in Indonesia get loans directly from financial institutions. On the other hand, We Are Social data show that in January 2019, 60% of the Indonesian people are smartphone users.

In view of these developments, Bank DBS Indonesia, which was named the World's Best Digital Bank 2018, through the Ecosystem strategy to reach out and serve people, has entered into collaboration with Home Credit Indonesia, a global fintech company with more than 3.6 million customers across Indonesia. ""We see a gap in the number of unbanked citizens that reaches 38% of the total population and the limited access to loan from financial institutions.

DBS creates Customer Centre of the future,02 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_creates_Customer_Centre_of_the_future, Singapore ,"- Voice biometrics specialists, live chat agents and customer experience designers. These are among the 13 new job roles1 that DBS has introduced in recent years, four of them in the past 18 months alone, as it creates the customer centre of the future to serve customers better. In the process, it has upskilled and retrained over 500 customer centre employees, and eliminated traditional customer pain-points such as long wait times to speak to customer service officers (CSOs). Customer Centres are traditionally labour-intensive departments. At DBS Singapore, the Customer Centre processes over four million inbound customer calls every year. But with new ways of serving customers better, call volumes have dropped 12% over the last year, and the bank expects call volumes to drop by a further 20% over the next three years. Jobs of the future, today With customers becoming more digitally-savvy, DBS has expanded its service channels online and on social media to engage and serve its customers in a way that is relevant to them. DBS Contact Centre has also incorporated technologies such as voice biometrics, chatbots and data analytics so that callers can enjoy shorter call waiting times and opt to resolve their banking queries independently via the bank’s website, on their mobile banking app or through the bank’s Facebook or Twitter channels. CSOs have been trained in these new areas. Geeta Sreeraman, DBS’ Head of Customer Centre, Singapore said that DBS’ Customer Centre transformation is an example of how the bank has invested in its employees, as well as in technology, to improve the overall customer experience. “By investing in our people, we have been able to transform from a labour-intensive department with a high turnover rate to one that is technology-enabled where employees are more fulfilled and armed with future-forward skills.” Building a digitally-ready workforce to create a better banking experience for customers is a priority for DBS, and this echoes Minister Heng Swee Keat’s recent comment about Singapore companies taking innovation and technology seriously, adapting to change quickly and not leaving any employee behind. “Our goal is to make our customers’ lives easier, especially when their lifestyle habits and expectations of how they would like to be served have changed. To do so, we need to ensure our employees have the skills and resources to better serve them,” Sreeraman added. Using voice biometrics to expedite customer identification even more securely DBS is using voice biometrics to verify customers’ identities through a system that digitises a person’s speech2. This is possible as the human voice is as unique as the fingerprint. This allows CSOs to automatically verify customers when they call in and customers no longer need to reveal personal information such as their date of birth or identity number when they are out in public. Automatic verification through voice biometrics also reduces the time taken to verify customers by up to 40 seconds from the usual average time of 80 seconds.  DBS’ voice biometrics is an opt-in programme and around half a million customers have been onboarded onto the service. The bank expects one in seven customers to be enrolled by the end of this year. Chatbots and ‘live’ chat functions  With customers becoming more comfortable with communicating with the bank digitally, they now want service at their fingertips and through social media channels that they are familiar with. DBS has taken that feedback seriously. A ‘live’ chat and chatbot function has been built into the DBS and POSB’s website and mobile banking app. Customers are benefitting from access to chatbots that can answer simple but popular banking questions such as “How do I check my bank account balance?” and “What is my credit card bill for this month?” in a few seconds. This function has proven to be popular among customers, and DBS is seeing a 10% increase in the number of chatbot engagements every month. Using predictive data analytics to anticipate customers’ needs  Data and digital dashboards are also used to map a customer’s journey with the bank. For example, by using behavioural and device performance data, the Customer Centre team can anticipate and solve potential issues - such as failed card transactions or having their card retained in an ATM – by assisting the customer via SMS, email or chatbot. Building on DBS’ predictive analytics model and using customers’ transaction patterns, the team will also be able to predict the services callers want by the second half of this year. After 13 years as a CSO, Lee Pei Ying underwent two half-day training sessions to learn how to engage with customers through DBS’ ‘live’ chat function. Having to communicate with customers through a new medium was initially stressful, but she learned to overcome challenges quickly. “I want to continue growing and developing my skills as a frontline employee, and I’m thankful that DBS is an employer that is committed to retraining its staff. The only constant is change, and the best thing I can do for myself is to keep learning and adapting to new environments,” she said. In 2017, DBS committed to investing SGD 20 million over five years to equip employees with digital skills to become a future-ready workforce. Since then, the bank has rolled out Singapore’s first company-led Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), an AI-based learning tool available 24/7, and scholarships that encourage peer-to-peer learning. The bank has also been conferred the inaugural CSISG (Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore) Award, presented to the company with the best customer service in the Finance and Insurance sector over the last decade. In addition, DBS has been lauded for its digital transformation journey and was named World’s Best Digital Bank by Euromoney twice in three years, a first for an Asian and Singapore bank. 1 New roles in DBS’ Contact Centre  1. Social media relations manager – DBS was the first bank in Singapore to introduce this role. As a social media relations manager, customer service officers manage customer reviews and feedback on DBS’ social media channels. 2. ‘Live’ chat agents – CSOs who manage ‘live’ chats with customers via the DBS and POSB website and mobile banking app. 3.

DBS boosts DBS Multiplier benefits to better serve customers’ long-term financial needs,01 May 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_boosts_DBS_Multiplier_benefits_to_better_serve_customers_long_term_financial_needs, Singapore ,"- Starting today, the popular DBS Multiplier programme will double its balance cap for bonus interest from SGD 50,000 to SGD 100,000. In addition, DBS Multiplier’s peak bonus interest rate for balances more than SGD 50,000 will be set at 3.8% per annum, making DBS Multiplier one of the most attractive “bank-and-earn” propositions in Singapore. The DBS Multiplier programme aims to reward consumers when they consolidate their finances with DBS/POSB. To enjoy higher interest rates on their DBS Multiplier account balances, customers simply need to credit their salaries to DBS/POSB and transact in one or more of the following categories: credit card spend, home loan instalment, insurance or investments. In late 2017, DBS Multiplier became the only programme of its kind in Singapore to have no minimum amount for salary credit or minimum credit card spend. Its unique proposition was met with overwhelming response: both DBS Multiplier customers and DBS Multiplier account balances have more than doubled since. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “With low barriers to entry, a clear and flexible proposition, as well as attractive bonus rates, we hope more consumers will take advantage of DBS Multiplier’s programme to become more proactive and engaged in their financial planning journey – to save, spend, protect and invest well. DBS Multiplier customers are steadily growing in financial savvy. Today, they are three times more likely to have insurance plans and/or investments compared to non-DBS Multiplier customers. In addition, some 40% of DBS Multiplier customers have grown their assets to beyond SGD 50,000. The latest enhancements aim to build DBS Multiplier for longevity, so we can grow with our customers and remain relevant even as their financial needs evolve.” DBS Multiplier’s new benefits were developed through consistent engagement with over 10,000 of the programme’s customers on DBS’ Facebook community The Burrow, which provides financial literacy tips and advice to DBS Multiplier users. The Burrow also provides a space for community members to interact and learn from each other. New DBS Multiplier benefits for balances above SGD 50,000 To enjoy bonus interest rates on DBS Multiplier account balances above SGD 50,000, customers need to credit their salaries to DBS/POSB and transact in three categories [1] . Benefits for balances up to SGD 50,000 remain unchanged. Eligible transactions are automatically detected by the bank across the DBS/POSB products held by customers, which means customers only need to deposit their funds in a DBS Multiplier account, while transacting with their usual DBS/POSB accounts to enjoy the higher interest rates. The following scenarios illustrate how DBS Multiplier can apply to customers across different life stages: Scenario 1 – New-to-workforce graduate Median salary credit [2] : SGD 2,800 (excluding CPF) Credit card spend per month: SGD 200 Total eligible transactions: SGD 3,000 Eligible interest rate: 1.85% p.a.

"DBS first-quarter net profit up 9% to record SGD 1.65 billion, return on equity at 14% | 繁體",29 Apr 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_quarter_net_profit_up_9pct_to_record_SGD_1_65_billion_return_on_equity_at_14pct," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group’s net profit for first quarter 2019 increased 9% to a record SGD 1.65 billion. Total income grew 6% to a new high of SGD 3.55 billion. Healthy business momentum and a higher net interest margin more than offset the impact of a high base for wealth management, brokerage and investment banking fee income as well as a property gain a year ago. New non-performing asset formation remained low and total allowances halved. Return on equity rose to 14.0%, the highest in more than a decade. Healthy business momentum underpins record performance Compared to the year-ago period, net interest income rose 9% to SGD 2.31 billion. Loans grew 5% in constant-currency terms to SGD 347 billion. The increase was led by non-trade corporate loans, which expanded 11% from broad-based activities across the region. Consumer loans were 3% higher. These increases were moderated by an 11% decline in trade loans due to unattractive pricing and a general market slowdown. Net interest margin increased five basis points to 1.88% in line with higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong. Net fee income was 2% lower at SGD 730 million. Wealth management, brokerage and investment banking fee income declined 12% in aggregate due to exceptionally buoyant market sentiment a year ago, but the impact was mitigated by fee income increases in other categories. Card fees increased 21% to SGD 189 million from higher customer transactions across the region. Transaction service fees rose 6% to SGD 188 million as both cash management and trade finance fees increased. Loan-related fees grew 9% to SGD 108 million. Other non-interest income rose 5% to SGD 511 million as increases in trading income and net gain on investment securities more than offset a property gain of SGD 86 million a year ago. Trading income rose 20% to SGD 443 million from gains in interest rate and credit activities. Net gain on investment securities doubled to SGD 53 million from a low year-ago base. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 15% to SGD 1.56 billion from higher deposit and bancassurance income. Institutional Banking income grew 10% to SGD 1.50 billion from higher cash management and loan income. Treasury Markets income increased 18% to SGD 293 million. The income growth from the three business units was moderated by a halving in Others income due in part to the property disposal gain a year ago. Expenses rose 7% to SGD 1.50 billion. The cost-income ratio was 42%, similar to a year ago. Profit before allowances increased 5% to SGD 2.05 billion. Earnings up 25% from previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, net profit was 25% higher, boosted by a recovery in wealth management and trading income. Overall business momentum was sustained. Net interest income rose 1% on a day-adjusted basis. Loans grew 1% as non-trade corporate loans increased 3% from working capital and deal-related borrowing led by Singapore and Hong Kong corporates. Trade loans declined 4%. Net interest margin rose one basis point. Excluding Treasury Markets activities, net interest margin rose five basis points mainly from higher interest rates in Singapore as well as the repricing of housing loans. Net fee income rose 15%. Wealth management fees increased 44% with a recovery in market sentiment from the previous quarter’s volatility. Loan-related fees were also higher. Other non-interest income grew 83% as trading income doubled from a weak quarter. Expenses were stable and profit before allowances was 18% higher. Balance sheet remains strong Asset quality continued to be benign. Non-performing assets were stable from the previous quarter at SGD 5.6 billion as new non-performing asset formation remained low. The NPL rate was unchanged at 1.5%. Total allowances fell to SGD 76 million, half the level a year ago and two-fifths the previous quarter. Specific allowances amounted to SGD 176 million, with charges for loans declining to 15 basis points from 20 basis points a year ago and 25 basis points in the previous quarter. There was a general allowance write-back of SGD 100 million, with half the amount contributed by improved portfolio credit quality and the balance due to an improvement in external credit conditions during the quarter. Allowance coverage rose to 100% from 98% in the previous quarter and 90% a year ago. Taking into account collateral, allowance coverage was at 181%. Deposits were stable from the previous quarter and rose 5% from a year ago to SGD 395 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio of 137% and the net stable funding ratio of 111% were both above the regulatory requirement of 100%. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio rose 0.2 percentage points from the previous quarter to 14.1% as earnings accretion outpaced risk-weighted asset growth. The leverage ratio of 7.3% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%. Dividend payment frequency changed to four times a year  The Board decided that, from financial year 2019, dividends will be paid four times a year, instead of two times a year, to provide shareholders with more regular income streams. The policy of paying sustainable dividends that rise progressively with earnings remains unchanged. For the first quarter, the Board declared a dividend of SGD 30 cents per share, consistent with the previous financial year’s payout of SGD 1.20 per share. The first-quarter dividend is scheduled to be paid on 31 May 2019. The final dividend of financial year 2018 of SGD 60 cents a share, which was approved by shareholders at the recent annual general meeting, is scheduled to be paid on 17 May 2019. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We have had a good start to the year as business momentum was sustained and non-interest income recovered from the recent weakness. The record earnings and ROE progression demonstrate the strengthened profitability of our franchise from digitalisation, a shift towards higher-returns businesses and more nimble execution. We are well placed to continue capturing growth opportunities across the region and delivering healthy shareholder returns.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

DBS Marina Regatta returns; seeks to inspire Singaporeans to be more eco-friendly,28 Apr 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Marina_Regatta_returns_seeks_to_inspire_Singaporeans_to_be_more_ecofriendly, Singapore ,"- The DBS Marina Regatta is back in its eighth edition, with a mission to educate and inspire Singaporeans from all walks of life to embrace a more sustainable lifestyle.  The highlight of the DBS Marina Regatta this year will be the 23,000 sq ft maze, constructed out of RENEW material, which is made from 95% recycled material, mainly compressed “straw” made from leftover stems of agricultural crops. Built as a sensory experience, adrenaline junkies and weekend warriors will have 12 minutes to climb, crawl, jump and swing their way through physical obstacles around the maze to test their physical speed and knowledge of critical issues facing the environment. This year, the DBS Marina Regatta participants will also be in for a gastronomical treat dished out by second generation hawkers who have finetuned generations-old recipes. From carrot cake with bacon to fresh seafood by the bay to halal kebabs and more, there is something in store for all visitors. The Marina Regatta will also be supporting the latest hawkerpreneurs and social enterprises so that event-goers can feast on creative eats like Impossible Burgers, churros, rainbow tea and grilled meats from around the region. Just as DBS has supported the growth of Singapore’s economy, it is also extending this support to aspiring musicians. The DBS Marina Regatta weekend will see more than 20 young buskers sing their heart out around the bay. The event will be a platform to showcase their talent and event-goers can also enjoy the music at the Jim Beam pop-up bar which will also be a feature at the DBS Marina Regatta. Upping the Ante on Green Initiatives  DBS will be using recycled, re-usable, and natural materials in various ways across the event. Reusable cups, bottles, and containers will be available. All F&B stall owners will also be provided with reusable crockery and tableware, as well as biodegradable recyclable containers for takeaways. DBS has also partnered with Sunseap, a sustainable energy provider, to set up 100 solar panels at the event venue. The solar energy generated will be used to power up Airbitat Smart Coolers, an eco-friendly and energy-saving alternative to conventional air-conditioning, that will be set-up around the Promontory. The solar energy will also be used to power certain parts of the event. Shee Tse Koon, Singapore Country Head, DBS said: “This year’s DBS Marina Regatta is a ‘race against time’ to raise eco-consciousness among individuals. Visitors can look forward to discovering and learning about sustainability issues through the immersive and interactive games and exhibitions. We have also collaborated with social enterprises on a curated series of sustainability workshops on upcycling, urban farming and soap-making.” He added, “We believe that a little goes a long way – every small effort we make today plays a big part in contributing to a sustainable world for future generations. We hope to inspire people to make small changes in their everyday habits, shaping a more sustainable Singapore. DBS Marina Regatta has taken significant steps towards becoming more eco-friendly – from using re-usable, natural materials to create signages, to replacing single-use plastics with biodegradable and reusable crockery.” Paddling for Asia’s Largest Dragon Boating Prize Purse  Organised in partnership with the Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA), the DBS Marina Regatta features the most global line-up of dragon boat teams from eight countries across Asia-Pacific and North America.

DBS – first Asian bank to launch digital token with enhanced security features to corporate and SME customers,28 Apr 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_Asian_bank_to_launch_digital_token_with_enhanced_security_features__to_corporate_and_SME_customers, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced that it will be providing a higher level of security and a better user experience to more than 200,000 of its corporate and SME customers on DBS IDEAL, the bank’s online banking platform for corporate and SME customers. Mr Raof Latiff, Head of Digital, Institutional Banking, DBS Bank, said that timely security enhancement is critical as DBS banks more than one in two SMEs in Singapore, many of whom are digitalising their businesses to keep pace with economic changes and consumption patterns. “At DBS, more than nine in 10 corporate and SME transactions are done online. These include cash transactions such as instant domestic and overseas payments,” said Latiff. With the introduction of the new DBS IDEAL digital token+, customers can now do away with their physical tokens. They will benefit from push authentication technology and more secure logins which tap on biometric facial recognition technology [1] on their mobile devices. With the latest security enhancements, authentication notifications to confirm logins and transactions will be sent via a secure network to customers’ registered mobile devices. This enables them to validate logins to their corporate accounts and perform and confirm online transactions anytime, anywhere. Previously, customers had to activate their physical or digital token app in order to authenticate and approve transactions. The new DBS IDEAL digital token+ eliminates the need for them to key in one-time passwords (OTPs) or SMS OTPs, which are more likely to be compromised. All they now need to do is confirm their transactions on their registered mobile device with a single swipe [2] . The DBS IDEAL digital token+ also adds more peace of mind and assurance to the transaction approval process. When approving a transaction, customers will benefit from an extra confirmation message delivered to their mobile device through a separate out-of-band channel [3] to verify transaction details. Said Latiff, “The DBS IDEAL digital token+ significantly enhances online security to mitigate transactions risks for our corporate and SME customers. It means that customers who are operating within a competitive and fast-changing digital landscape can now focus on the things that matter and grow their business and be future-ready without having to doubt the security of their transactions. By employing new technologies to meet their increasing security needs, we continue our relentless approach of thinking one step ahead to protect our customers from risks that arise from this digital age.” The DBS IDEAL digital token+ will be available to all IDEAL users across DBS’ key markets in Asia from May 2019. IDEAL users currently using the IDEAL digital token will be automatically migrated to the new IDEAL digital token+ service. ______________________________________________ [1] Only for mobile devices that are enabled with biometric technology [2] The new DBS IDEAL digital token+ taps on the latest security techniques to facilitate end-to-end encrypted communication between DBS IDEAL and a secured authentication service. [3] An out-of-band channel is a separate data stream (eg. to the mobile device), independent from the main in-band stream (eg. to the desktop) More information about DBS IDEAL token+ can be found here  [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

The Current and Future State of Indonesia’s Economy from Women’s Perspective | Bahasa,01 Apr 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/The_Current_and_Future_State_of_Indonesias_Economy_from_Womens_Perspective, Indonesia ,"- Indonesia's economic growth rate of more than 5% is considered quite good amid the dynamics of the global economy. This was confirmed by Sri Mulyani, the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, in her statement at the 2019 Asian Insights Conference organized by Bank DBS Indonesia in January, that Indonesia's economic growth was strong because it was supported by consumption, investment and government spending. However, 100 Indonesian female economists believe that Indonesia can achieve an even higher economic growth rate. One of the 100 Indonesian female economists is Masyita Crystallin, DBS Bank economist for Indonesia and the Philippines. According to Masyita, another important factor that demonstrates the quality of economic growth is the stable prices of staple goods in recent years. Masyita believes that the current consumption rate is still quite high, even higher than 5.05%, because in the first semester of 2019 household consumption is affected by the legislative and presidential elections. Masyita adds that inflation only ranges between 3-3.5%, and only stood at 2.47% in March 2019. Who is Masyita Crystallin? Let’s find out more about her. After obtaining her bachelor's degree and graduating top of her class from the Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), University of Indonesia (UI), Masyita continued her studies at the Australian National University and Claremont Graduate University for her master's degree and doctoral degree in economics with capital flows her main research topic.

"DBS issues standalone sustainability report, first Singapore bank to do so",28 Mar 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_issues_standalone_sustainability_report_first_Singapore_bank_to_do_so," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- In line with its commitment to advancing the sustainability agenda as a purpose-driven bank, DBS today issued its inaugural standalone sustainability report, the first Singapore bank to do so. The report provides an expanded account on progress made in supporting the United Nations’ set of Sustainable Development Goals [1] (SDGs) and material sustainability matters over the past year. DBS’ approach to sustainability is based on three pillars – (i) Responsible banking, (ii) Responsible business practices and (iii) Creating social impact. Within these pillars, the bank has chosen to focus on six SDGs, namely SDG 5 – gender equality, SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 – industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 12 – responsible consumption and production and SDG 13 climate action. In the Sustainability Report, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said that some of the challenges facing the world – challenges in the developmental, social and environmental space – are enormous and complex. “It is our firm belief that companies such as ours have a central role to play in seeking to find solutions to these challenges. Our licence to operate comes from civil society, and we need to ensure that we are addressing the needs of multiple stakeholders, not just for our generation but for generations to come. Our approach to sustainability is guided by this sense of purpose: to create value for the long term, by managing our business in a balanced and responsible way.” He also reflected that in seeking an appropriate balance, the bank is mindful that more often than not, there are numerous trade-offs that need to be made. As an example, there are inherent trade-offs even in some of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with the quest for improvement in basic living conditions sometimes coming at the cost of environmental degradation. “These trade-offs must be carefully evaluated as the solutions are often not binary.” Progress made by the bank in its sustainability efforts is summarised below:  Pillar 1: Responsible banking – delivering products and services that promote sustainable development and conducting business in a fair and responsible manner. Some examples: In the area of responsible financing, DBS provided sustainability financing amounting to more than SGD 2.4 billion in 2018. This included green loans, sustainability performance-linked loans and renewable energy financing. In the area of climate change, the bank is committed through its business activities to promote an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, while balancing the need for economic growth and social inclusion. As an example, it supported clients’ issuances such as Start Energy’s Wayang Windu geothermal green project bond and the State Bank of India’s maiden green bond. In the area of digital finance, DBS has joined the Sustainable Digital Finance Alliance and the UN Task Force on Digital Financing for SDGs. These collaborations address the potential for fintech-powered business innovations to reshape the financial system in ways that better align with the needs of sustainable development. In support of the financial inclusion agenda, through the years, DBS has lent a total of SGD 38 billion to SMEs. DBS’ social enterprise (SE) banking package also offers SEs unsecured business loans at a preferential rate of 5% fixed per annum. In Singapore, the bank is the bank of choice for many migrant workers, and waives fees for ex-offenders to help their reintegration into society. Pillar 2: Responsible business practices – doing the right thing by employees and taking into account environmental and societal considerations in day-to-day business operations. Some examples: In support of diversity and equal opportunity, DBS seeks to create a workplace that is supportive of employees as they grow and thrive in different aspects of their lives. In 2018, the bank enhanced its parenthood leave which includes maternity, paternity and adoption. It also introduced neonatal care leave for employees who require additional support when their child is born prematurely. For the second year running, the bank was included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. In the area of sustainable procurement, DBS requires all new suppliers to be reviewed against its Sustainable Source Principles (SSP), which outlines the expectations the bank has of its suppliers in four key areas – human rights, health and safety, environmental sustainability, as well as business integrity and ethics. In 2018, 99.6% of new suppliers signed their commitment to support DBS’ SSP. Pillar 3 - Creating social impact – being a Force for Good by supporting social enterprises – businesses with a dual bottom line – and giving back to the communities . Some examples: In the area of social entrepreneurship, the DBS Foundation awarded SGD 1.25 million in grants to 12 SEs through the SE Grant Programme in 2018. The programme enables social enterprises to develop a prototype of their idea, add critical capabilities for business sustainability, or scale up existing businesses, leading to greater social impact. In 2018, DBS employees also mentored more than 50 SEs across its six core markets to help scale their businesses.

DBS and SIA embark on wide-ranging partnership across multiple digital platforms,26 Mar 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_SIA_embark_on_wide_ranging_partnership_across_multiple_digital_platforms, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank and Singapore Airlines (SIA) have today come together to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to enhance digital capabilities across various digital platforms, to enable a seamless banking and travel customer experience for travellers. Under the MOU, the two companies will introduce flight booking and merchandising capabilities on DBS’ platforms, a DBS-SIA Rewards Programme on KrisPay [1] , and the expansion of payment options for SIA customers using PayNow, via Application Programming Interface (API) technology. The MOU is in line with SIA’s move to enhance digital capabilities company-wide, and DBS’ vision to make payments simple and hassle-free for customers through building integrated digital ecosystems. “We are excited to be teaming up with DBS, which has been twice globally recognised as the World’s Best Digital Bank. The partnership will provide great benefits to both our companies, given our shared aim to be a digital leader in our respective industries, with enhanced customer benefits through new flight booking, merchandising and reward programme ties,” said Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial, Mr Mak Swee Wah. As the first bank partner that SIA will connect via API for flight ticket sales and KrisShop, DBS customers can now look forward to booking their holidays on the soon-to-be-launched DBS Travel Marketplace which will allow one to purchase flights, book hotels and buy travel insurance on a single integrated platform. “We are thrilled to partner Singapore Airlines, winner of multiple best airline awards, to create an inclusive digital travel ecosystem for our customers,” said Mr Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Manager. “Singaporeans are among the most well-travelled in the world with over 10.3 million overseas trips made in 2018 alone. Through this partnership, we would be able to elevate the consumer travel experience by offering extensive travel and retail options for travellers to choose from and customise their journeys right at the start.” Facilitated by API technology, the collaboration is also expected to cover the following areas: DBS-SIA Rewards Programme, where KrisFlyer members can instantly convert DBS points into KrisPay miles via the KrisPay app. Miles can subsequently be used for retail purchases at KrisPay partners island-wide. Alternatively, the KrisPay miles can be converted into KrisFlyer miles instantly within seven days of accrual. DBS is SIA’s first conversion partner on KrisPay. By including PayNow as a payment mode, SIA can offer its passengers the flexibility and convenience to pay for their flights from their bank accounts using PayNow, and issue tickets instantly once the payment is done. This is made possible by DBS IDEAL RAPID, an enhanced solution that offers Instant Credit Confirmation, as well as consolidated daily credit and reporting. The comprehensive solution also includes other value-added options like automated refunds; for instance, if a trip is cancelled or changed, SIA can refund the outstanding amount back to the passenger’s bank account. The initiatives will be gradually rolled out this year, beginning with the DBS Travel Marketplace, with the full suite of updates to be made available by end of 2019.

Cipta Piranti Sejahtera, the company that develops cloud accounting software Accurate Online. Through this collaboration, DBS Bank Indonesia wants to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) save time and human resources. Once SMEs link their Bank DBS Indonesia corporate accounts with Accurate Online, each business transaction carried out by SMEs with Bank DBS Indonesia corporate accounts that are connected to Accurate Online will be automatically entered and recorded in Accurate. Set-up is easy and doesn’t require any paper forms; SMEs simply authorise the connection once via IDEAL internet banking and bank feeds from DBS will flow into Accurate Online daily. Once the bank transactions are in Accurate Online, its “Smart Reconciliation” feature will try to match bank transactions with the accounting entries, saving hours of user’s time in doing bank reconciliation. This also means that SMEs have an up-to-date view of their cash flow and can hence make better-informed financial decisions. The manual tasks of importing bank transactions and reconciling are eliminated. “As the World’s Best Bank for SMEs, we want to be a banking solution for SMEs in Indonesia by providing various facilities and insights that can help SMEs make decisions in their business. This collaboration is part of the implementation of our mission ""Live more, Bank less"" that enables customers to enjoy life to the fullest without having to worry about administrative banking matters. We also found that many SMEs and start-ups were using Excel or physical paper for book-keeping. Given the tedious nature of the task, they tend to do reconciliation only once a month, so had an outdated view of their cash flow.,” said Rudy Tandjung, Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia. Accurate Founder Darwin Tjoe added, ""By using DBS corporate accounts that are connected with Accurate Online, SMEs can easily do and monitor their bookkeeping. DBS Indonesia and Accurate Online customers can also benefit from cost-savings.

This marks a key milestone for the bank, which has been present in India for 25 years. DBS set up a representative office in India in 1994 and opened its first bank branch in 1995. It currently operates in 12 cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Nashik, Surat, Kolhapur, Salem, Cuddalore and Moradabad. With DBIL, DBS will accelerate its growth plans, expand its operations and build greater scale in India through a “phygital” model to further serve large corporates, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and individual customers. DBIL intends to establish over 100 customer touchpoints – a combination of branches and kiosks – across 25 cities in the next 12-18 months. This month, DBIL will open nine new branches and extend its reach to Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore, Vadodara, Indore and Ludhiana.

It will also open five branches in unbanked rural centres. Commenting on the launch, DBS Bank India CEO Surojit Shome said, “This is a significant milestone for DBS India as it enables us to deepen and embed our commitment to growing our franchise in India in a sustainable manner. Over the last few years, we have harnessed the power of technology to reimagine banking and provide innovative banking solutions for individuals as well as business customers. The launch of DBIL will enable us to further build our relationship with our customers and create differentiated offerings as financial services continues to transform rapidly with changes in technology and consumer preferences”.

We believe it is important to continue investing in Asia’s two biggest markets – China and India. In 2016, we launched digibank, a groundbreaking mobile-only offering, in India. We recently started piloting data-driven lending solutions for small and medium enterprises. The creation of a full-fledged subsidiary in India allows us to scale up further and bring to customers a more compelling proposition.” DBS, which was named Best Bank in the World in 2018, has been on an ongoing journey to shape the future of banking. Since the launch of digibank by DBS nearly two years ago, the bank has acquired over 2.5 million digibank customers in India.

The creative industry is a significant contributor to state income, contributing Rp922.59 trillion to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 and Rp1.009 trillion in 2017. Meanwhile, November 2018 data showed that creative industries contributed Rp1.105 trillion to state revenue. The increase was driven by technological developments and trends that encouraged young Indonesians to pursue a creative career. The dynamic and rapidly evolving trends that drive millennials have triggered tight competition to win the market. Indonesian millennials are competing to be the most outstanding with unique creative ideas. Creative ideas can certainly come from various sources, especially social media, but what can generate ideas other than social media? You can attend events, such as creative economy conferences, including C2 Montreal, a unique annual business conference held in Montreal, Canada that presents speakers from  a variety of backgrounds. Check the four fascinating facts about the C2 Montreal business conference that are no less exciting than a music festival: 1. C2 Montreal 2019 has the theme “Tomorrow”, shaping the future of business as of now The C2 Montréal 2019 conference with the theme ""Tomorrow"" is certainly exciting and interesting, featuring great speakers. The conference, to be held on 22-24 May 2019, features inspirational figures and creative leaders who will share their insights.

This is the realization of C2 Montreal's mission, which is to inspire not only from a business perspective but also from the perspective of the world's creative industry players.  3.

Business momentum was maintained over the course of the year despite heightened economic uncertainty and financial market volatility in the second half. Total income increased 11% to SGD 13.2 billion from loan and fee income growth as well as a higher net interest margin, which were partially offset by weaker Treasury Markets income. Return on equity rose more than two percentage points to 12.1%, the highest in more than a decade, attesting to the improved structural profitability of the DBS franchise as interest rates and allowances reached more normalised levels. Fourth-quarter earnings increased 8% to SGD 1.32 billion. Total income grew 6% to SGD 3.25 billion as sustained loan growth and net interest margin progression over the quarter were moderated by a decline in Treasury Markets income. Full-year earnings increase 28% Full-year net interest income rose 15% to SGD 8.96 billion. Net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 1.85% with higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong. Loans grew 6% in constant-currency terms to SGD 345 billion. Non-trade corporate loans increased 12% from steady broad-based growth across the region through the year. Consumer loans rose 3%, with a softening in the second half due to Singapore residential property market cooling measures and volatile financial markets. Trade loans declined 6% as maturing exposures were not replaced due to unattractive pricing. Net fee income rose 6% to SGD 2.78 billion. Card fees increased 31% to SGD 714 million from higher customer transactions in Singapore and the consolidation of the retail and wealth management business of ANZ. Wealth management fees grew 18% to SGD 1.14 billion mainly from higher bancassurance income. Transaction service fees increased 5% to SGD 647 million as a 13% rise in cash management fees was moderated by lower trade finance fees. These increases were partially offset by a 41% decline in investment banking fees to SGD 128 million as debt and equity capital activities were affected by market uncertainty. Other non-interest income fell 4% to SGD 1.45 billion due to lower gains on investment securities, partially offset by property disposal gains. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management (CBG/WM) income rose 21% to SGD 5.65 billion from increases in all product categories led by deposits, cards and bancassurance. Institutional Banking (IBG) income grew 9% to SGD 5.76 billion from higher cash management income. Treasury Markets income declined 21% to SGD 672 million due to unfavourable market conditions. Expenses rose 13% to SGD 5.80 billion. ANZ accounted for five percentage points of the increase. The underlying cost-income ratio excluding Treasury Markets and ANZ was maintained. Profit before allowances increased 9% to SGD 7.39 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings up 8% from year ago For the fourth quarter, net profit rose 8% from a year ago to SGD 1.32 billion. While business momentum remained healthy, the results were dampened by weakness in Treasury Markets income. The combined income of CBG/WM and IBG rose 16% to SGD 2.95 billion, while Treasury Markets income halved to SGD 92 million. Net interest income rose 11% to SGD 2.33 billion. Net interest margin increased nine basis points to 1.87% with higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong. Loans grew 6% in constant-currency terms to SGD 345 billion. Non-interest income fell 4% to SGD 915 million. Fee income was stable at SGD 635 million as increases in card, transaction service and loan-related fees were offset by declines in investment banking, wealth management and brokerage fees. Other non-interest income was 13% lower at SGD 280 million from lower gains on investment securities. Expenses rose 11% to SGD 1.50 billion, with ANZ accounting for six percentage points of the increase. The underlying cost-income ratio was stable. Profit before allowances rose 3% to SGD 1.74 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings 7% below previous quarter  Compared to the previous quarter, fourth-quarter net profit was 7% lower. The combined income of CBG/WM and IBG income was slightly higher while Treasury Markets income fell three-fifths. Net interest income grew 3% as loan growth and net interest margin progression were sustained over the quarter. Net interest margin rose one basis point to 1.87%. A two-basis-point increase due to higher interest rates in Singapore was moderated by a drag from Treasury Markets activities. Loans rose 2% in constant-currency terms from growth in non-trade corporate loans. Consumer and trade loans were stable. Fee income fell 9%. Declines in wealth management and loan-related fees were partially offset by increases in card and transaction service fees. Other non-interest income fell 31% due to weaker trading income. Expenses rose 1% while profit before allowances was 8% lower. Balance sheet remains strong Compared to the previous quarter, non-performing assets fell 4% to SGD 5.68 billion. The NPL rate declined from 1.6% to 1.5%. Total allowances for the fourth quarter were SGD 205 million, bringing the full-year amount to SGD 710 million. Full-year specific allowances were at 19 basis points of loans. Allowance coverage was at 98%, up five percentage points from the previous quarter and 13 percentage points from a year ago. Allowance coverage was at 178% after taking collateral into account. Deposits rose 2% from the previous quarter and 5% from a year ago in constant-currency terms, in line with loan growth, to SGD 394 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio of 138% and the net stable funding ratio of 109% were both above the regulatory requirement of 100%. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio increased 0.6 percentage points from the previous quarter to 13.9% due mainly to net profit accretion. The leverage ratio of 7.1% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%. The Board proposed a final dividend of 60 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This will bring the payout to $1.20 per share for the full year. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We achieved financial results befitting our fiftieth anniversary, a year when we were also recognised as the world’s best bank and best digital bank. Return on equity of 12.1% was near the historical high of 2007, when interest rates were twice the levels today and capital requirements less stringent. The structural improvements we have made to the profitability of our franchise – a shift towards higher-returns businesses, deeper customer relationships and more nimble execution – put us in good stead to navigate the challenges of the coming year.” [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia with a presence in 18 markets.

8 in 10 SMEs want more business incentives to help address urgent challenges,15 Feb 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/8_in_10_SMEs_want_more_business_incentives_to_help_address_urgent_challenges, Singapore ,"- A dipstick poll conducted by DBS over the last week revealed that SMEs[1] in Singapore are looking to the government to give them a leg-up in supporting their business growth this year. Eight in 10 said they are expecting more business incentives to be announced at the upcoming Budget announcement. This is because challenges such as manpower issues (26.5%), high operational costs (21.5%) and growing business revenue (21%) in a difficult economic environment continue to plague SMEs. Push for re-training and upskilling gains momentum While SMEs continue to grapple with manpower challenges such as hiring the right people (43%) and retaining employees (27%), four in five SMEs said their employees are now equipped with the right skills for the job. The government’s SkillsFuture efforts are also paying off as nine in 10 SMEs polled said that they now have access to affordable training programmes. “Many of our SMEs customers have channelled resources to upskilling their employees so that they can improve their overall productivity and efficiency. The benefits reaped are plentiful, and they can now focus their efforts on other parts of their business, such as growing their revenue and expanding overseas,” said Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank. With their employees armed with the tools and resources to drive business growth, SMEs are now focused on maintaining/growing market share (30%), growing their business revenue (29%), and developing their digital business capabilities (23%). Overseas expansion on the horizon  Despite Singapore’s domestic economy slowing and global trade uncertainties looming, 18% of SMEs polled are looking to expand overseas this year. However, 55% of SMEs cited the lack of market knowledge and understanding of regulatory requirements as the main challenges of overseas expansion. A quarter said that they could not find the right partner to collaborate with. With these challenges ahead, seven in 10 SMEs are turning to government agencies for advice. 27% are seeking guidance on partnerships and business grants, 24% on internationalisation and scaling up their business and 19% are looking forward to receiving assistance on tax-related matters. “Even though smaller businesses typically require more assistance in weathering storms, innovation, nimbleness and the ability to adapt to change quickly will enable SMEs to thrive in uncertain times,” said Tee.

DBS sets record with digital alternatives this Chinese New Year,14 Feb 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_sets_record_with_digital_alternatives_this_Chinese_New_Year, Singapore ,"- DBS QR Ang Baos, the world’s first loadable QR red packets, were launched on 25 January to strong public interest. Since then, customers appear to have taken to the novel solution very quickly: the bank has recorded more than SGD 1.3 million being loaded onto DBS QR Ang Baos.  The growing interest and comfort in using digital alternatives for CNY is further reflected in the usage of DBS PayLah!’s eAng Baos, which have steadily risen in popularity since they were first introduced in 2015. The number of eAng Baos sent in 2018 was six times higher than that of 2017. This year is no different, with eAng Bao usage hitting yet another record high for CNY: the average number of eAng Baos sent per day this CNY is double that of last year. In addition, the bank has seen a jump of more than 40,000 new DBS PayLah! eAng Bao users during this period. Here are some interesting facts on the users of DBS’ digital CNY alternatives:  DBS PayLah! eAng Bao DBS QR Ang Bao Background First eAng Bao in Singapore; launched in Jan 2015 First loadable QR Ang Bao in the world; pilot launched in Jan 2019 Age group of majority users 20 – 29 years old 30 – 49 years old Peak period (for sending eAng Baos / loading QR Ang Baos) 5 Feb 2019 (“初一”; CNY Day One) 5 Feb 2019 (“初一”; CNY Day One) % of eAng Baos / QR Ang Baos with SGD 8 or above in value 50% were SGD 8 or above 64% were SGD 8 or above (All figures are accurate as of 13 Feb 2019) Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “We’re excited to see the public’s warm reception to both DBS QR Ang Baos and eAng Baos this year. As with the practice of exchanging red packets during Chinese New Year, some traditions are timeless. For any innovation to succeed, it is key to find a balance between technology and preserving core traditional values, and to continue iterating based on feedback. With our DBS QR Ang Baos, eAng Baos and traditional red packets, we are glad to provide different ways to send blessings for the new year. Regardless of the medium, we hope the red packets were able to bring people together and spark joy this CNY.” Jayne Lam, 53 years old, homemaker, noted, “I like that it cuts out a lot of hassle – there’s no need to queue for new notes, no need to count and pack the money. Inserting new notes into red packets sounds simple but can be very troublesome when you have many CNY preparations to rush. With the DBS QR Ang Bao, I can easily prepare it while on the way to my next visiting destination, which saves time. I also save on a trip to the bank to deposit my children’s ang bao collections!” Wayne Toh, 23 years old, student, agreed, “The QR Ang Bao is really useful. Saves me time and effort because now I don’t have to bank in my CNY money.” DBS introduces “Ang Bao Recycling Bins” in push to reduce waste With 2019 designated as Singapore’s Year towards Zero Waste, DBS has become the first bank in Singapore to launch a recycling initiative for red packets.

To attract a bigger pool of female applicants, DBS is stepping up its game by launching Hack2Hire-Her. “DBS is well-recognised for its gender diversity agenda and recently included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the second consecutive year. Increasing female representation in our technology roles will enable us to tap into a wider talent pool and ensure greater diversity of ideas in everything we build. This is a crucial differentiating factor to help us drive superior client experience in our digital transformation journey,” she said. One beneficiary of DBS’ diversity agenda is Evelyn Loo, a mobile app developer who joined the bank through Hack2Hire last year. “Working in DBS’ technology team has been great for my career. It has opened my eyes to the possibilities of growing in not just technology, but the banking industry as well. I have picked up design thinking skills that help me build and code with the customer in mind while being continuously challenged to keep up with the latest technology trends. The supportive environment of continuous learning and growth has enabled me to develop myself to the fullest potential.” DBS Hack2Hire consists of two parts - an online assessment challenge to gauge the relevant technical capabilities of candidates, followed by a live two-day hackathon, where the candidates approach to problem solving and teamwork will be put to the test. Shortlisted candidates from the second round will be offered full-time roles at DBS. Interested candidates, both male and female, can apply online here - https://www.dbs.com/hack2hire/sg/index.html [1] The role of a chaos engineer involves the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system to build confidence in the system's capability and withstand turbulent conditions in production.

The wide-ranging initiative includes the introduction of Singapore’s first sustainability major, as well as funding for sustainability research, scholarships, fellowships and community engagement. The DBS-SMU Sustainability Initiative, which the bank plans to commit more than SGD 1 million towards [1] , aims to provide further support to academics, businesses and students passionate about tackling real world sustainability challenges. For the first time, the SMU Lee Kong Chian School of Business will be offering a major in sustainability in Academic Year 2019. The major aims to develop graduates who will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to implement sustainable practices in businesses that lead to long-term, measurable impact. The partnership was sealed with the signing of an agreement by Professor Gerard George, Dean of Lee Kong Chian School of Business at SMU and Shee Tse Koon, Singapore Country Head at DBS Bank. Said Shee Tse Koon, Singapore Country Head at DBS Bank, “Being purpose-driven is part of DBS’ DNA. This harks back to our mandate when we were established more than 50 years ago as the Development Bank of Singapore and carries forward to the present day with championing sustainability being a big part of our agenda. In particular, one focus area is how we can create social impact, whether through our support of social enterprises, or by partnering with business, communities and the public. In many ways, Singapore is well-placed to become a model city for sustainable development and our hope is that this partnership will cultivate a thriving pool of talent and businesses that will help us become a world-class centre of sustainable development excellence.” Professor Gerard George, Dean of SMU Lee Kong Chian School of Business said, “Increasingly, businesses have embraced sustainability as part of their strategic goals. Many companies consider a sustainability strategy necessary to be competitive today and in the future. The multi-pronged efforts under the DBS-SMU Sustainability Initiative will help nurture SMU students to meet the needs of the job market, foster research excellence and build intellectual capacity among our faculty, as well as raise the general awareness of sustainability issues. We are excited about this collaboration with DBS, and are confident that the various endeavours under the DBS-SMU Sustainability Initiative will make a meaningful impact on SMU and the community at large, thereby contributing to the overall sustainability movement in Singapore.” The DBS-SMU Sustainability Initiative includes the following: (1) Establishment of DBS Sustainability Fellowships Two DBS Fellowships will be established to attract and retain research scholars in the field of Sustainability who will conduct research in sustainability and expand outreach efforts to create meaningful impact. The inaugural fellowships are expected to be awarded in time for Academic Year 2019, which commences in August.

The scholarships are open for application by full-time SMU undergraduates who are Singaporeans or Singapore Permanent Residents, are proceeding to Year 3 and have declared Sustainability as a Second Major. The new second major in Sustainability, offered by SMU Lee Kong Chian School of Business from Academic Year 2019, is the first such specialisation in sustainability offered within a business degree programme in Singapore. It aims to develop business executives who are well-versed in sustainability issues that confront the world, have a good understanding of the role that businesses can play in contributing to sustainability goals, and are equipped with the theories, frameworks, and tools to tackle sustainability issues. Applicants are also required to have outstanding academic and leadership qualities, and demonstrate a passion for Sustainability. The inaugural scholarships are expected to be awarded in Academic Year 2019 commencing in August. Each Scholarship shall be valid for up to two years of the recipient’s studies, i.e. Year 3 and Year 4. (3) Annual DBS Sustainability Business Study Mission One DBS Sustainability Business Study Mission will be organised per academic year, starting in Academic Year 2019 for SMU students to visit regional centres of excellence in sustainability. These study missions will provide added experiential learning opportunities, as well as help develop skills such as critical thinking and practical application. (4) DBS-SMU Talent Enterprise Development Every year, SMU will pair students with relevant skills to work on projects related to organisational improvement in (up to) 10 social enterprises which DBS Foundation supports. In this programme, students will provide support and receive valuable on-the-job learnings in various areas of the businesses, such as developing digital strategies for effective and sustainable media campaigns; identifying innovative and effective ways of raising the organisation’s visibility and fundraising yields; reviewing current processes and minimising inefficiencies; as well as exploring entrepreneurial approaches to benefit clients and organisations. Each project team will comprise of two SMU students, with the first batch of project teams expected to be in place from May-July 2019. Participating social enterprises include Adrenalin, Bettr Barista, boxgreen, CaptionCube, Edible Garden City, Homage, Treedots, UglyGood and WateROAM. [1] The bank has committed to contribute SGD 600,000 in the first two years of the partnership Appendix As part of the bank’s efforts to address the growing social issues in Asia, DBS Foundation was started by the bank in 2014 with a SGD 50 million fund to champion social entrepreneurship across the region. The bank’s commitment to sustainable development has since grown and it was the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index, a global sustainability index. The bank is also the first Asian bank and first Singapore company to join global renewable energy initiative RE100. DBS has pledged to power 100% of its Singapore operations using renewable energy by 2030. As part of this commitment, the bank installed 1,200 solar panels at its office buildings in Changi Business Park. Today, 40% of DBS’ total energy consumption in Singapore comes from renewable sources. In 2017, DBS launched Singapore's first green bond by a financial institution and helped to promote green ﬁnance through the issuance of a USD 500 million green bond. In the same year, DBS was also the sole bookrunner for the first green bond by a Singapore company – City Developments’ SGD 100 million green bond. Last year, in conjunction with the introduction of DBS’ “Live more, Bank less” ethos, the bank upped the ante on its commitment to becoming more socially conscious and launched the “Recycle more, Waste less” eco-movement, with a focus on encouraging Singaporeans to reduce their consumption of single-use plastics – a particularly pressing issue in Singapore.

Waste4Change Together with Bank DBS Indonesia Realizes Trash-Free Indonesia | Bahasa,01 Feb 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Waste4Change_Together_with_Bank_DBS_Indonesia_Realizes_TrashFree_Indonesia, Indonesia ,"- Waste management has continued to pose a serious challenge that needs special attention in Indonesia. A report submitted by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) revealed that 100,000 tons to 400,000 tons of plastic waste enter Indonesia’s ocean waters per year. At that rate, by 2050 the amount of plastic waste will exceed the number of marine biotas. Jakarta alone produces 7,200 tons of waste per day. Alarmed with the state of waste in Jakarta, Bijaksana Junerosano, better known as Sano, felt compelled to bring about change. Sano then established Waste4Change, a waste management service company that not only provides garbage transportation and sorting services but also strategic services to companies in Indonesia. ""We established Waste4Change as a solution in the form of a responsible waste management service company. The number '4' in the name Waste4Change denotes four areas, namely: Consult, provides consultations based on in-depth research and training on responsible waste management; Campaign, provides education to companies, residences, schools and communities about the importance of responsible waste management; Collect, collects waste from residential or commercial areas to be brought to the Waste4Change office to be sorted; Create, collaborates with trusted partners to convert waste into recycled materials,"" said Sano, founder of Waste4Change. Waste4Change’s mission is to realize a trash-free Indonesia and to collaborate with Bank DBS Indonesia to achieve the goal. Waste4Change started the business by participating in DBS Foundation’s programs, such as business workshops, social entrepreneurship assistance and business coaching. In 2018, Waste4Change collaborated with Bank DBS Indonesia as a waste management vendor. Established in 2014, the company provides waste management services to several clients, including the Vida Bekasi housing complex. Waste4Change does not only provide waste management services but also educates residents of the housing complex about waste management. Currently, more than 1,700 homes and large companies partners with Waste4Change. ""We want to create a waste-free Indonesia. To realize this mission, we cannot work alone. Therefore, we collaborate with a company that has the same mission, namely Bank DBS Indonesia, through a variety of activities including to provide education for school children. Recently, we held a 3R School Adoption education program in Bekasi to provide knowledge and to develop the right mindset about waste from an early age,"" said Sano. A distinctive feature of Waste4Change is the use of the “Zero Waste to Landfill” method. Using the method, Waste4Change sorts waste at the source and processes the waste without sending it to the Final Disposal Site (TPA), and comprehensive reporting of waste transportation. Sano added, ""This year we will cooperate with the Jakarta Provincial Government for overall waste management in Jakarta. This is a good step to creating a waste-free Indonesia."" In a video uploaded by Bank DBS Indonesia on the official DBS Indonesia YouTube channel, Sano shares inspiring insights into Waste4Change’s waste management system.

"Indonesia’s Economic Growth Rate Up 5% in 2018, Economy Will Improve in 2023 | Bahasa",31 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Indonesias_Economic_Growth_Rate_Up_5_in_2018_Economy_Will_Improve_in_2023, Indonesia ,"- Coinciding with Indonesia’s political year, Bank DBS Indonesia held DBS Asian Insights Conference featuring Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia Sri Mulyani, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, and several economists. The annual conference, with “Accelerating Growth for Future-Forward Indonesia” and “Game Changers: New Futures, New Opportunities” as its themes, wanted to provide predictions of opportunities and challenges that will be faced by Indonesia amid the development and the domestic political climate as well as a volatile world economy. The global economic volatility that is caused by the threat of US-China trade war greatly affects the global economy. The prospect of a slowdown in the world economy has also made stock markets volatile, with the S & P 500 index declining 17% from its highest level in September 2018. In addition, the MSCI Index fell 15% from its highest level in the same month. In fact, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the global economic volatility signals a looming financial crisis. Indonesia recorded a pretty good growth amid the dynamics of the world economy in 2018. Indonesia’s economy grew by around 5%. This is indicated by the realization of state revenue that reached 100% of the State Budget (APBN) target at the end of 2018. Budget deficit was considered healthy, reaching Rp278 trillion by late November 2018, or 1.89% below the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) --the figure is below the APBN target of 2.19%. Inflation was under control. This was confirmed by Sri Mulyani, the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia. She said that Indonesia booked a solid growth last year, sustained by consumption, investment and government spending. ""We expect end-of-year momentum to contribute to economic growth to 5.15-5.17% levels. Behind the indicators of economic growth, there are many development indicators that truly matters to the people, ""said Sri Mulyani. She went on to say that this also reduced the level of poverty in the country to  a historic low. ""For the first time, we achieved a single digit poverty rate, at 9.66%, compared to 9.8% in March 2018."" Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, added that in addition to a higher economic growth and a lower poverty rate, Indonesia's inflation rate was quite good until the end of 2018. This was indicated by the inflation rate, which was below 3%. ""If managed well, our economy will improve until 2023. We must be optimistic about our current economic condition because we can keep inflation below 3%. There will be no significant threat over the next 10-15 years. Therefore, from now on we must focus on building infrastructure and human resources,"" he concluded. DBS Bank Ltd. Chief Economist Taimur Baig revealed the strategies that Indonesia can adopt to maximize opportunities in 2019. ""Amid external influences, such as the threat of US-China trade war and The Fed's decision, as well as the influence of internal factors, namely the general elections, Indonesia must focus on domestic demand. An increase in domestic demand is an opportunity for Indonesia. For the record, this does not mean that external demands, such as exports, imports, manufacturing and mining, are not important. Indonesia has a huge population that is dominated by dynamic younger generations. The large number of new businesses and startups in Indonesia has become one of Indonesia's attractive points in the eyes of the world. Through domestic demand alone Indonesia can grow at 4%-5%,"" he said. DBS Asian Insights Conference is a manifestation of Bank DBS Indonesia's commitment to realizing the ‘Live more, Bank less' mission. ""We want the people of Indonesia to be able to enjoy a better life without being bothered by trivialities, especially in terms of banking. Based on this mission, we are committed to becoming a leader in providing comprehensive insights, especially related to business and economy. Through this event, we hope to be able to help businesspeople in making decisions and determining the future direction and achievements,"" said Paulus Sutisna, President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia.

"DBS on drive to Recycle more, Waste less with employees and public",30 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_on_drive_to_Recycle_more_Waste_less_with_employees_and_public, Singapore ,"- Within the cafeteria of DBS’ Exchange Hub in Singapore, straws can no longer be found. For Chinese New Year this year, the bank handed out red packets as usual but without any plastic wraps. Clients visiting DBS Treasures lounges here drink from glasses and recyclable paper cups, without a plastic bottle in sight. These are but a few examples of the steps DBS has taken in its drive to “Recycle more, Waste less”. Last year, in conjunction with the introduction of DBS’ “Live more, Bank less” ethos, the bank upped the ante on its commitment to becoming more socially conscious and launched the “Recycle more, Waste less” eco-movement, with a focus on encouraging Singaporeans to reduce their consumption of single-use plastics – a particularly pressing issue in Singapore. According to the Singapore Environment Council (SEC), Singaporeans use at least 1.76 billion plastic items a year, of which less than 20% is recycled. Singapore shoppers also take 820 million plastic bags from supermarkets every year. DBS’ call to “Recycle more, Waste less” has since resulted in more than 50,000 people pledging to adopt simple and easy steps in their daily lives – such as saying no to straws or ditching plastic bags for reusable ones – that reduce their consumption of single-use plastics. Said Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing and Communications at DBS Bank, “At DBS, we believe we have an important role in helping to build a more sustainable society for future generations. Our aim with ‘Recycle more, Waste less’ is to shift how we collectively view recycling and conservation and bring about positive changes in people’s attitudes and behaviours. Together, we can become a more socially conscious society through small, simple and easily achievable lifestyle changes. We believe these everyday actions can result in significant long-term benefits for our island state.” In its support of Singapore’s green push, DBS has adopted the following eco-friendly practices: 1. Changing procurement practices : DBS has drastically reduced its use and purchase of disposable plastic water bottles in Singapore, resulting in some 7.3 tons of plastic waste being saved every year. The bank also works with its tech vendor to reuse and reduce packaging for its electronic items, saving an estimated ton of plastic waste per year. This year, the bank also eliminated the use of plastic wraps for its red packets, avoiding 220 kg in plastic wastage. 2. Making it easier for employees to adopt sustainable practices : The bank has distributed 4,000 reusable bags (which fold easily to become tiny, zipped pouches), 2,000 Sporks (a hybrid metal cutlery tool shaped like a spoon and a fork at either end) and 2,500 sets of metal straws to help employees lead more eco-friendly lives. More than 1,300 employees have also pledged to an ongoing campaign to reduce their carbon footprint in 2019. DBS also recently carried out a six-week campaign that saw some 200 staff volunteers (or “Eco-Heroes”) drive greater awareness on recycling among employees. The campaign has resulted in over three times more recyclables (close to 1,900 kg) being collected. 3. Helping Singaporeans to become more environmentally-conscious : The bank gave away 20,000 reusable water bottles last year to attendees of the DBS Marina Regatta and Social Enterprise Summit. 8,000 Sporks were also given out as part of a “pledge-for-Sporks” campaign across universities, food outlets and hawker centres in Singapore. 4. Working together with like-minded partners : In December 2018, DBS partnered the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) to jointly launch the ‘One Less Plastic’ national campaign with four leading supermarket chains – Dairy Farm Singapore Group, NTUC FairPrice, Prime Group and Sheng Siong – to encourage the use of reusable bags among supermarket shoppers. To date, some 30,000 reusable bags have been distributed through the partnership. Today also sees the launch of the DBS Sparks Studio, located at the bank’s headquarters in the Marina Bay Financial Centre district. Designed flexibly as a “studio by day, communal hub by night”, DBS’ new in-house content studio will also serve as an interactive space for communities – which includes social enterprises supported by DBS Foundation, interest groups within the bank, as well as public interest groups – where they can gather, network, organise or attend events. DBS’ green initiatives are part of the bank’s commitment to sustainable development. It was the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index, a global sustainability index. The bank is also the first Asian bank and first Singapore company to join global renewable energy initiative RE100. DBS has pledged to power 100% of its Singapore operations using renewable energy by 2030. As part of this commitment, the bank installed 1,200 solar panels at its office buildings in Changi Business Park. Today, 40% of DBS’ total energy consumption in Singapore comes from renewable sources. In 2017, DBS launched Singapore's first green bond by a financial institution and helped to promote green ﬁnance through the issuance of a USD 500 million green bond. In the same year, DBS was also the sole bookrunner for the first green bond by a Singapore company – City Developments’ SGD 100 million green bond.

5 Influential Indonesians Who Attend Asian Insights Conference 2019 | Bahasa,30 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/5_Influential_Indonesians_Who_Attend_Asian_Insights_Conference_2019, Indonesia ,"- It is not uncommon to hear people complain about the country’s growing debt, ignoring the fact that state revenue is also increasing. It is not that people don’t care; they only ignore facts due to a lack of understanding about the actual condition. Negative sentiments, particularly related to state affairs, can be reduced by collecting a lot of information about Indonesia’s economic condition. Certainly, the views of influential figures can serve as a reference to gain insight into Indonesia’s economic condition. To that end, Bank DBS Indonesia as a financial institution that consistently provides insights that could help economic players determine business directions and prospects, held the DBS Asian Insights Conference in Jakarta on January 31, 2019. The annual event gathered policymakers and economists to share their views on the prospects Indonesia's economic growth as one of the key drivers of Asian economic recovery. The leaders who attended the conference were selected based on their competencies, point of view and knowledge. Who are they? Following are five of the influential figures who attended Asian Insights Conference 2019: 1. Sri Mulyani Sri Mulyani, economist and Indonesia's Finance Minister since 2016. Sri Mulyani has gained recognition not just in Indonesia but also on the international stage. A former managing director of the World Bank, she is the first Asian to occupy the position. Given her ability, Sri Mulyani often represented the World Bank at the G20. Very inspirational, right? 2. Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan Managing the largest archipelagic state in the world is not easy. This is the responsibility of Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, who currently serves as Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs. In 2015, Luhut was appointed by President Joko Widodo as Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs. The appointment was influenced by Luhut's performance as Presidential Chief of Staff for about nine months, starting in December 2014. 3. William Tanuwijaya This young Indonesian businessman is the founder e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia. His love for the Internet led William to launch Tokopedia in 2009, though not without facing various obstacles. With a vision of creating income equality through technology, Tokopedia has reached Unicorn status with a market valuation of more than US $ 1 billion. Thanks to Tokopedia's success, William has emerged as one of the most successful young entrepreneurs in the country. For the past nine years, William has received numerous awards, including the prestigious Youth Global Leaders award in 2016 as one of the most influential young leaders in the world. 4. Denni Puspa Purbasari Denni Puspa Purbasari, director of the Center for Economic and Public Policy Studies at the University of Gadjah Mada (UGM), is an example of people who attain success by consistently following their chosen path. A graduate of UGM’s Faculty of Economics, she obtained her master’s degree in policy economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a Fulbright scholarship in just one year. Denni obtained her Ph.D. in economics from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Her achievements serve to underline the fact that education definitely helps advance your career. 5. Taimur Baig An economist at DBS Bank Ltd, Taimur plays a significant role in the development of economic research activities undertaken by DBS Group Research. No surprise here as Taimur is the man behind Asian Insights, the research activities conducted by DBS Bank to make economic projections until 2030. An economic leader and macro strategist, he also advises DBS Bank on risk management and investment strategies. This year’s DBS Asian Insights Conference discussed the challenges that affect Indonesia’s economic growth rate and explored strategic measures viable for the country. The views of economists and political observers could help gauge opportunities and determine the direction of investment in 2019. Bank DBS Indonesia sees that 2019 is a challenging year, not only for capital market players but also for investors. Therefore, the DBS Asian Insights Conference was expected to give business people and investors an idea of Indonesia’s and global economic conditions to help them make business decisions and determine business directions. ### About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

No New Year’s Resolutions Yet for 2019? Consider the following tips | Bahasa,24 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/No_New_Years_Resolutions_Yet_for_2019_Consider_the_following_tips, Indonesia ,"- Daily activities and technological developments that support routine tasks make people physically inactive. In fact, physical inactivity affects your general health. The best way to start a new year is to abandon bad habits and set new resolutions, such as: 1. Healthy living Many of us made a pledge to embrace a healthy lifestyle a long time ago but have yet to make good on the promise. In fact, a healthy lifestyle is not difficult to achieve --drinking 2 liters or 10 glasses of water per day, getting enough rest by not staying up late and exercising, among other things-will suffice. There’s no need to buy a costly gym membership. You can start by running around your housing complex. The key is discipline and regularity, especially given the fact that in Indonesia running is growing in popularity and a positive trend in society. 2. Pursue a hobby You can start with a cardio workout, such as running, which has been sidelined by your daily activities. Cardio workout is easy to do because it only needs running shoes and determination. You can share your beautiful photos while running wearing matching activewear in social media such as Facebook and Instagram. 3. Add new achievements to your list of accomplishments You only live once, so take advantage of any opportunity to the best of your ability to be able to extend your list of achievements. One easy way to do this is by joining a quiz or a competition that suits your hobby. Besides gaining more experience, you will also be able to gauge the extent of your abilities. There is nothing wrong with that. Who knows, you could win ... There is an activity that can help you realize one of the three new resolutions. Bank DBS Indonesia through DBS Live More Society holds the DBS Runnin 'Berlin Instagram photo competition under the theme of ""Fit more, Stress less"". DBS Live More Society is a manifestation of the ""Live more, Bank less"" mission to ensure convenience for customers in conducting banking activities. The DBS Runnin Berlin photo competition, which runs from January 7 until March 25, 2019, is aimed at increasing people's interest in a healthier lifestyle through positive activities such as sports. Participants are first required to download the digibank by DBS app via their cell phone, set and take a screenshot of an appointment with digibank by DBS agents, then register and upload the appointment screenshot on https://go.dbs.com/runninberlin . Participants can upload photos under the theme of ""Fit more, Stress Less"" on Instagram and mention @dbsbankid and @indosweatcamp by inserting the #LivemoreBankless #LiveMoreSociety and #DBSRunninBerlin tags. ""The Berlin Runnin DBS competition is an extension of our mission ‘Live more, Bank less’, through which Bank DBS Indonesia consistently presents various opportunities for the public to be able to give meaning to life and to not worry about banking matters as it is our job to provide banking services that facilitate human life in line with current technological developments. It is hoped that the DBS Runnin 'Berlin competition can be an opportunity for people to refresh themselves and to unplug from their daily routines so that they can enjoy and give meaning to life,"" said Mona Monika, Executve Director, Head of Strategic Marketing & Communications Group, PT Bank DBS Indonesia. Every month a winner will be selected to join a marathon in Berlin, Germany. There are other prizes as well, such as a Garmin Forerunner 235 for the runner-up, Jabra Elite Sports Wireless earbuds for the second runner-up, and Mi Band 3 smart bracelets for three favorite winners.

DBS pilots world’s first loadable QR red packets,23 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_pilots_worlds_first_loadable_QR_red_packets, Singapore ,"- DBS is introducing a new way to celebrate Chinese New Year (CNY) this year with the pilot launch of a loadable QR red packet (DBS QR Ang Bao), a global first. The DBS QR Ang Bao offers a fun, digital twist on the age-old tradition of red packet exchange, allowing DBS PayLah! users to preserve the traditional act of giving and receiving physical red packets, while eliminating the use of cash. This pioneering solution allows users to go beyond simply scanning or generating QR codes to make payments and fund transfers. DBS QR Ang Baos provide users with the ability to ‘load’ their desired cash values onto unique QR codes – the first time in the world that this functionality is being introduced in QR codes. How DBS QR Ang Baos work Using DBS PayLah!, Singapore’s most popular mobile wallet with more than one million users, customers simply need to scan a unique QR code on a DBS QR Ang Bao to ‘load’ a cash value of up to SGD 999. They may then gift the DBS QR Ang Bao to their family and friends, who can scan the QR code with their own DBS PayLah! app to receive the loaded amount. Visit https://youtu.be/CxAD6pnxWuM to watch a short video on how the DBS QR Ang Bao works. Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “In the spirit of celebration and reinvention this Chinese New Year, we decided to introduce a fresh, digital take on the traditional red packet exchange, while retaining the meaningfulness of the physical act of giving and receiving red packets itself. The pilot also showcases the different, unexpected ways in which digital funds can replace cash. The DBS QR Ang Bao is ideal for time-starved customers who hope to forgo the usual hassle of obtaining new notes for CNY, or for those who embrace the spirit of being early adopters and appreciate having conversation-starters during family gatherings.” Each DBS QR Ang Bao contains a unique QR code and serial number for added security, and users can easily cancel a particular DBS QR Ang Bao’s loaded funds via the DBS PayLah! app in the event that it gets lost or stolen. This latest innovation comes on the back of the rising popularity of DBS PayLah!’s eAng Baos – the first eAng Baos to be introduced to Singapore in 2015. eAng Baos reached a record number of transactions in 2018, with the number of eAng Baos sent in 2018 being six times higher than that of 2017. How to get your DBS QR Ang Baos Starting 25 January 2019, limited quantities of DBS QR Ang Baos will be made available to customers who wish to try them out. Two sets (in packs of eight) of DBS QR Ang Baos will be distributed to customers at 95 DBS/POSB branches or POSB Pop-Up ATMs island-wide (please refer to the Appendix for the list of collection points), subject to availability. The DBS QR Ang Baos will be valid for use from 25 January 2019 to 15 March 2019; funds not redeemed by 15 March 2019 will be refunded to the givers. Introducing the DBS PayLah! QR Ang Bao Contest Customers who successfully send or redeem a DBS QR Ang Bao or DBS PayLah! eAng Bao are eligible to participate in the DBS PayLah! QR Ang Bao Contest.

Have You Ever Thought of Living Cash-free? 7 Fun Facts of Being Part of a Cashless Society | Bahasa,23 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Have_You_Ever_Thought_of_Living_Cashfree_7_Fun_Facts_of_Being_Part_of_a_Cashless_Society, Indonesia ,"- Technological developments have triggered changes in lifestyle, including in the way Indonesians perform transactions. Today, people are accustomed to cashless transactions using digital payment technologies as they are heading toward a cashless society. The Consumer Payment Attitudes Study released by Visa (2016) revealed that Indonesians prefer electronic payment cards over cash. The study also found that 34% of Indonesians carry a small amount of cash compared to five years ago because 71% of them prefer payment cards and 59% believe that carrying cash is no longer safe. The trend is in line with the National Cashless Movement (Gerakan Nasional Non Tunai, GNNT) initiated by Bank Indonesia in 2014. Undeniably, the transition is driven by innovative, efficient, safe, and easy-to-use payment technologies. What about you? Are you a part of a cashless society? Let's take a look at all the advantages of being part of a cashless society: 1. Lots of promos? Definitely! Transactions using non-cash payment methods are actually very beneficial to society. This is reasonable because many merchants offer discounts and cashbacks to loyal customers. As a result, we pay less for any items we buy and can save money in the process. 2. Greater control of spending Can't you believe it? Ever heard of the term spending tracker? Non-cash payments besides being faster and more efficient, it also allows you to monitor various transactions that have been done before. You can know how much money is spent on certain posts, for example shopping for basic necessities, eating in restaurants, doing hobbies, and other activities. Through this report, of course you can plan your finances better every month. 3. Zero interbank transfer fee Transfer fee is a common issue we face when we want to transfer money, whether to family members or friends who have different bank accounts. Without realizing it, we pay for interbank transfers. Although  the amount seems insignificant, it can cause a dent in our account, particularly when we have to make several transfers to several different accounts. You will surely feel burdened by the transfer fees. Now, you no longer need to worry about transfer fees because a solution is available, namely zero-fee transfer service. As the name suggests, the service allows you to transfer money anytime, anywhere without having to worry about transfer fees. In fact, digibank by DBS offers zero-fee transfer service using an application that enables transfers of up to Rp200 million per day to any banks! Are you sure you still don't want to be part of a cashless society? 4. No need to wait in a long queue at toll gates After the government made it mandatory to pay for toll roads using e-cash cards, e-money cards have become a necessity for motorists. Indirectly, anyone using the method has become part of a cashless society! The use of e-money certainly accelerates the payment process at toll gates and saves motorists time because they need only to tap the e-money card on the GTO. The transaction is processed automatically and the payment will be automatically deducted from your bank account. Anyone who has the Near Field Communication (NFC) feature on their Android smartphone can easily update their e-money balance, anywhere, after a top-up using the Pay Buy feature on DBS’s digibank app. 5. No need to visit a branch to open an account To open a bank account, you no longer need to visit a branch, take a number, and queue, thanks to electronic or digital services that enable bank customers to conduct all banking activities independently. How is it possible? Thanks to the use of biometric identification in the form of fingerprints on e-KTP, verification and security data of each customer has been recorded and integrated, reducing the time it takes for a customer to not just open an account but also to  transfer fund or check the balance using banking apps. So, are you a member of a cashless society who use banking apps or do you still visit a branch to conduct transactions? 6. Safer and more efficient transactions Although convenience is important, ultimately security is the main factor that must be guaranteed. Initially, people tended to hesitate to switch from cash to e- money. They wondered if their money would be safe and would not be stolen by irresponsible parties.  As members of a cashless society, you must be familiar with the term OTP, one time password, and hard token. The two features help ownership verification and guarantee the security of your account. However, e-money does become less efficient if you have to verify your identity each time you make a transaction or bring additional tools wherever you go to conduct transaction. No need to worry. There are soft token services that only require one password for all transactions. It’s safe and easy. 7. Make use of interactive features in app When we rely on systems, everything becomes more practical and controlled. However, there are times when we are confused about how to use a system or what to do when a system fails just when we want to conduct a transaction. You know what? There is an interactive feature called Digibot, an artificial intelligence (AI) platform by DBS. Digibot will answer all your questions about digibank. For those of you who have become part of a cashless society, there is no need to be confused anymore about who to ask because Digibot provides chat, fund transfer, and balance inquiry services for customers, 24/7! Digital transformation is the main focus of Bank DBS Indonesia. DBS Bank has won numerous international awards from world-renowned publications, such as ”The Best Bank in the World” award from Euromoney and “Global Bank of the Year” award from The Banker, for its digital transformation, one of which is through digibank by DBS. All the advantages of being part of a cashless society can be gained through digibank by DBS. Such features as spending tracker, zero-transfer fee, Pay Buy for e-money top-up, opening an account using biometric technology, soft tokens, and Digibot are available to ensure easy transactions for customers using their mobile apps. ""Undeniably, technology makes things easy for us in various aspects, especially in doing daily activities. Knowledge of digital banking and various banking services is crucial for customers in choosing solutions for their financial needs. It is important for you to make the right choice of banking products and services that meet your needs. It will be even better if the banking products are not just a tool or a facility for transactional needs but also an investment,"" said Leonardo Koesmanto, DBS Indonesia Head of Digital Banking. Leonardo added, ""Technology makes things easy for us and enables us to conduct all banking activities via our mobile devices. This is in line with our mission Live more, Bank less to help customers enjoy life better and to not be bothered by complicated banking matters.

DBS leads the pack as ASEAN’s strongest brand,23 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_leads_the_pack_as_ASEANs_strongest_brand, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank’s digitalisation efforts, making the customer experience simpler and more seamless, have propelled it up the ranks. For the first time, DBS is now ASEAN’s strongest brand, and among the top 40 strongest brands in the world, based on Brand Finance’s “Global 500 2019” annual report. According to the “Global 500 2019” report, DBS obtained a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score of 86.8 out of 100, up by over five points from 81.2. This translates to the bank being the 38th strongest brand in the world, up significantly from 144th in 2018. DBS’ brand strength now surpasses major global players such as Dove, Prada, Pepsi, Red Bull, Starbucks, Porsche, Emirates, Adidas and Nestle. Brand Finance determines the relative strength of brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance. Customer perception comprises the largest portion of the BSI, with customers polled on their familiarity with the brand, consideration and preference of the brand, satisfaction with the brand, and whether they would recommend it to others. Samir Dixit, Managing Director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific, said, “As ASEAN’s strongest brand, DBS has integrated technology and digital aspects in its core product offerings to enhance their consumer experience in a seamless and non-disruptive manner. Consumers are seeking disruptive solutions but not at the cost of a complete disruption to the customer experience. DBS has managed to balance this well and this is one of the key contributors to their brand strength and business growth.” Along with the level of revenues, brand strength is a crucial driver of brand value. As DBS’ brand strength significantly improved this year, its brand value also grew, rising 38% to USD 9.02 billion. Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications at DBS Bank, said, “DBS’ unrelenting focus on digitalisation is driven by the desire to make banking invisible so that our customers can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. Being named one of the top 40 strongest brands in the world, ahead of many established global brands, is testament to our focus on reimagining banking. We are honoured to once again fly the flag high for Singapore on the global stage.” In 2018, DBS won more than 20 global awards including Global Bank of the Year by The Banker, Best Bank in the World by Global Finance, and World’s Best Digital Bank by Euromoney. The Brand Finance “Global 500” is an annual study conducted by Brand Finance, the world’s leading brand valuation and strategy consultancy, and published in ‘The Banker’ magazine. The study ranks the world’s biggest brands by brand value using the Royalty Relief approach – a brand valuation method compliant with the industry standards set in ISO10668. The results of the study are reflective of global trends and future developments. The Brand Finance “Global 500 2019” report was launched on 22 January in Davos, Switzerland.

DBS named to Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for second consecutive year,16 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_to_Bloomberg_Gender_Equality_Index_GEI_for_second_consecutive_year," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank has made it to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the second year running, featuring among 230 companies from 10 sectors headquartered across 36 countries and regions worldwide. The sector-neutral index, which is based on a self-disclosure survey on gender-equality performance, measures gender equality across internal company statistics, employee policies, external community engagement as well as gender-conscious products and services. Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “We believe that gender equality is essential to effective and sustainable development. Progressive companies that embrace gender equality are more likely to have more diverse ideas and avoid groupthink, which ultimately leads to better decision-making. We are honoured to have made the GEI index for the second year, to be recognised for our commitment to driving parity for an inclusive work environment. In Singapore, close to 60% of DBS’ overall workforce are women, and women make up 40% of our senior management (senior vice presidents to managing directors). In addition, more than one-third of our Group Management Committee are women who run the bank’s largest businesses and key functions.” DBS has a slew of policies that provide flexibility to women. The bank’s workplace policies are designed to benefit employees and their families in terms of flexible time arrangement, sabbatical leave arrangement, savings, well-being and medical protection. To further boost the diversity of gender, nationality, skills and knowledge among the bank’s Board of Directors, DBS adopted a diversity policy which continues to be implemented today. In addition, DBS Foundation, the first foundation in Singapore dedicated to championing social entrepreneurship, supports and funds numerous social enterprises that empower disadvantaged women and girls. “We applaud DBS and the other 229 firms tracked by the index for their action to measure gender equality through the Bloomberg GEI framework,” said Peter T. Grauer, Chairman of Bloomberg and Founding Chairman of the U.S. 30% Club. “DBS’ GEI inclusion is a strong indicator to its employees, investors and industry peers alike that it is leading by example to advance ongoing efforts for a truly inclusive workplace.” The 2019 GEI doubled in size from 2018 and includes companies headquartered in countries including Argentina, China, Finland, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. These companies, which function in various sectors such as communications, energy, financials, and health care, have a combined market capitalisation of USD 9 trillion and employ more than 15 million people – of which seven million are women – around the world. Disclosures from firms included in the 2019 GEI provide a wide-ranging and comprehensive look at how companies around the world are investing in women. According to GEI data: • Women had a 40% increase in executive level positions between fiscal years 2014-2017. • 60% of firms conduct compensation reviews to identify gender-based variations in pay to close their average 20% pay gap (18% on average in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Middle East regions and 26% in Asia-Pacific). • 34% have programmes in place to recruit women looking to return to work after a career break. • For U.S. employees, the average number of weeks of fully paid primary leave offered is 13 weeks, and the average number of weeks of fully paid secondary leave offered is five weeks. • 43% of firms cover gender reassignment services in health insurance plans. • 68% of firms evaluate all advertising and marketing content for gender biases prior to publication.

SMEs who are trying to keep pace with the technological shifts in the local and global economy can access accounting, HR and payroll, digital marketing, ecommerce, and cybersecurity solutions to give them a leg up.  Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said that the DBS SME Connect portal will empower SMEs with the tools to grow and scale their business in these fast-changing times. “The needs of SMEs are diverse, and as their banking partner, we want to provide a greater selection of solutions that will help them build their foundational digital capabilities and accelerate their transformation journey.

Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and DBS partner on ITE-wide financial literacy curriculum,09 Jan 2019,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Institute_of_Technical_Education_ITE_and_DBS_partner_on_ITE_wide_financial_literacy_curriculum, Singapore ,"- The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and DBS Bank today announced that the two parties have entered into a two-year partnership to develop and implement an ITE-wide financial literacy programme. Senior Minister of State (Ministry of Trade and Industry & Ministry of Education), Mr Chee Hong Tat officiated at the signing event, which was held at ITE Headquarters. Empowering Students with Data Insights Offered as enhanced segments within mandatory modules under the Lifeskills curriculum, the programme aims to empower the first batch of 10,000 ITE student participants with data insights that transform financial literacy into a meaningful and relatable subject, which will spur students to apply what they learnt to their daily lives. Lessons will be made authentic, engaging and relevant to students through a unique use of data analytics and design thinking, so they can better learn and understand financial literacy concepts set out in the MoneySense curriculum. Financial Habits of ITE Students These topics, and the way they will be taught to students, are jointly developed by DBS and ITE based on feedback and insights gathered from students and their lecturers through several immersion sessions organised by DBS last year. In learning more about the students’ money habits and their attitude towards money, it was found that: • Their spending is more focused on their day-to-day needs. Top three categories they spend most frequently on include: grocery/snack shopping (35%); dining (25%); shopping (15%). • More ITE students are putting their money towards savings, as compared to their peers. Five in 10 ITE students save, versus four in every 10 of their peers. But while the students do save, it is usually towards a purchase rather than for rainy days. • Financial literacy topics with a longer time horizon, such as insurance and investments, are challenging for them to relate to and remember. • They typically receive their allowance in cash, posing a challenge for them to track their spending efficiently, and thus do not have an intimate grasp of their personal finances. • Students learn better by doing, and so there is a need to incorporate hands-on activities to help them internalise learning by putting concepts into practice. Ms Low Khah Gek, CEO, ITE, said: “We are excited to work with DBS in developing a curriculum on Financial Literacy, leveraging DBS’ strong data analytics capabilities. Through this, we will be able to draw insights into the spending and saving habits of the Youth-Adult population, including ITE students. The power of such analytics is that we now have new and authentic ways to engage with our students to help them understand their spending patterns and habits. We are also able to help them look ahead into the future and understand how their spending needs and demands may change as they move into different stages of their lives.” Aim of Partnership Working hand-in-hand with lecturers from ITE, the DBS-ITE Financial Literacy Curriculum Partnership seeks to: • Introduce digital tools and encourage the adoption of cashless payment methods, which allow students to track their spending digitally anytime and manage their money. An example is the DBS/POSB Your Financial GPS – Singapore’s first holistic digital financial advisor available for free – where users can check their spending across multiple expense categories, set and track budgets, and make use of personalised insights and financial advice to better manage their finances. • Supplement theoretical concepts with action-oriented learning; for example, when students are taught the basics of budgeting, they will be encouraged to create their personal financial plan at the same time with digital banking tools. • Make each lesson relatable to students through the use of practical examples and real-life scenarios that they are familiar with or may find themselves in. “Developing a healthy relationship with money and being responsible for one’s personal finances is an important step towards achieving financial wellness,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS Bank. “At DBS, we are privileged to bank nearly all of Singapore, and so we believe in stepping forward to partner ITE in this meaningful initiative that will help students develop good financial habits. Such habits will allow them to take charge of their financial health, plan well for the future, and reap the benefits as they progress later in life.” Using Data Analytics to Measure Positive Change in Students’ Money Habits The curriculum will also leverage DBS’ extensive data analytics capabilities where, by using data as a feedback loop, programme administrators are able to measure positive change in the students’ financial habits. Such success can be quantified as more students being seen saving; saving more; or using a financial planner to set budgets and track against financial-life goals. “Like we do in financial planning, it is imperative that we set success metrics for the programme and be able to measure its impact and influence on students. By actively monitoring the students’ overall progression towards holistic financial wellness, it also helps us adjust and tailor the topics taught in future iterations to make each one even more useful for the students,” said Soo.

Let's Try These 5 Ways to Take Care of the Environment in 2019! | Bahasa,27 Dec 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Lets_Try_These_5_Ways_to_Take_Care_of_the_Environment_in_2019, Indonesia ,"- People were shocked by news reports that broke at the end of this year about a sea turtle that was found dead at Congot beach, Yogyakarta, with its stomach clogged by plastic waste . Equally shocking was news that a whale was found dead off Wakatobi’s waters, Southeast Sulawesi, its stomach full of plastic waste consisting of 750 gr of plastic cups (115 pieces), 140 gr of hard plastic (19 pieces), 150 gr of plastic bottles (4 pieces), 260 gr of plastic bags (25 pieces). These incidents raised concerns about Indonesia’s environmental sustainability. A report submitted by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, LIPI), revealed that  between 100,000 and 400,000 tons of plastic waste are dumped into the sea. If this practice continues, it is predicted that by 2050 the amount of plastic waste will exceed the total sum of marine biotas. Given these facts, changes are crucial. We as individuals can also contribute in simple ways to improve Indonesia’s natural environment. Do you want to know how? Let’s consider these 5 simple ways: 1. Consider the Packaging of the Food and Beverages We Buy Food and beverages are mostly packaged in plastics and Styrofoam. Therefore, we must be smart in choosing food and beverage containers in restaurants or cafes. As consumers, we can make changes. We can start with small things like asking for our coffee to be served in a cup rather than a plastic or paper cup when drinking coffee in a coffee shop. 2.Use Reusable Tableware The use of disposable plastics can also be reduced by using reusable tableware, such as a lunch box, a tumbler, and stainless steel straws. We can carry reusable tableware with us wherever we go, whether to bring home some food or to use when we eat out. If we forget to bring our own food containers, several restaurants in Jakarta use reusable containers for takeaways that we can reuse. 3. Carry and Use a Tote Bag When Shopping Plastics are used a lot when we shop at supermarkets and retail stores. We can replace plastic bags with tote bags. Tote bags are made from materials that allow multiple use. There are different shapes and motifs to suit our taste so that we can be more stylish while shopping. 4. Use Less Tissue Paper Tissue paper is made of a material that breaks down easily when exposed to water. As a result, people think nothing of the amount of tissue paper they use and do not limit the use according to need. In fact, tissue paper is made from trees and this can affect forest sustainability and living things. Therefore, use tissue paper sparingly or replace it with cloth napkins that can be washed and reused. 5. Join an Environmental Community and Movement Aside from making small changes to our daily habits, we can also bring change by joining an environmental community and a social movement, such as Bank DBS Indonesia’s Live More Society. Live More Society is a community platform designed to encourage millennials to give more meaning to life by showing care for the environment, among other things. One of Live More Society’s environmental programs  is Recycle more, Waste less, which is carried out in collaboration with the government and social entrepreneurs engaged in environmental affairs such as Waste4Change. Recycle more, Waste less is aimed at raising the environmental awareness among Indonesia’s millennials to bring change, starting with changes to their daily habits. Through the program, Bank DBS Indonesia invites Indonesia’s millennials to protect the environment through social media. Every post by a social media user who is committed to protecting the environment will be valued IDR 1,000.00 and the funds raised from the program will be used for waste management. ""The Recycle more, Waste less movement will also encourage Indonesia’s millennials to be more critical of their immediate environment. For example, they can report illegal garbage dumping, take photos, create social media posts, tag our location and our social entrepreneur partner, Waste4Change, who collaborates with the regional government. Through the program, we as a banking institution want to invite Indonesians, particularly millennials, to better understand life by showing care for the environment. How can we have a better understanding of life if the natural environment we live in is increasingly polluted?"" said Mona Monika, Executive Director, Head of Group Strategic and Marketing Communications PT Bank DBS Indonesia. Mona added, ""To make changes we don’t need to start with something big. We can start with something small, such as making changes to our small habits, so that in the long run the impact will certainly be felt.""  ***  About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

Three Things You Need to Know About Digital Banking | Bahasa,17 Dec 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Three_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Digital_Banking, Indonesia ,"- Today’s technology development ease our way of life as consumers in our daily activities, including on banking transactions. At the moment, banking activity is done through one app in smartphone. Who doesn’t know the internet banking and mobile banking term? These day’s it’s now called internet banking. Let’s find out three things about digital banking that you ought to know: 1. Digital Banking does not require a branch office or is branchless Banks operate through physical distribution channels with more than one branch offices and sub-branch offices across Indonesia to meet customer needs. Digital banking is a banking service using a bank's electronic or digital facilities that allows customers to perform banking activities independently. Digital banking not only allows customers to perform banking transactions digitally but also to perform banking activities that are usually only performed through branch offices digitally, such as account opening, deposit and investment. Digital banking is different from Internet banking or mobile banking, which are limited to such banking transactions as fund transfer or balance check. This means customers still have to go to a bank’s branch to perform other banking activities in a conventional manner. 2. Digital Banking is more than just a banking application The difference between digital banking and mobile banking lies in the features provided in one application. Mobile banking allows customers to perform transactions that can be done via ATMs, such as fund transfer, bill payment, and phone credit purchase. Meanwhile, digital banking allows customers to carry out banking activities that are normally carried out at sub-branch offices, such as opening new accounts, opening time deposit accounts, making investment, and topping up e-wallets. For example, the deposit feature on digibank by Bank DBS Indonesia allows customers to open time deposit accounts using the application. The pay and purchase feature is a favorite among customers as it allows them to pay bills and shop on e-Commerce sites. Today, the pay and purchase feature also allows customers to top-up e-Money easily because the feature is also equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology for Android. 3. Digital Banking Based on Indonesia’s Biometrics-enabled E-KTP Biometric technology that is used in e-KTP is a technology that is not only used for civil registration but can also be used as a database in the banking industry. Using biometric identification, such as fingerprints, verification and security data of each customer has been recorded and integrated to shorten the time customers have to spend when registering their account and verifying their data when logging in or performing transactions. In addition, this reduces human error, such as forgetting the PIN,  that commonly happens when logging in or performing transactions. It is different from mobile banking and Internet banking services that requires Personal Identification Number (PIN) to log in and perform transactions, which is troublesome because customers are prone to forgetting their PIN. Today, digital banking has become a basic need for many customers in Indonesia to carry out daily banking activities. Digital banking products and services are thriving, one of them is digibank by DBS. The app has various services and products to facilitate customers in making interbank fund transfers online, with  zero administration fee. In addition, the investment and savings features can be accessed easily and quickly via the deposit feature. Digital transformation is the main focus of Bank DBS Indonesia. Bank DBS has won numerous international awards from world-renowned publications, such as The Best Bank in the World from Euromoney and Global Bank of the Year from The Banker, for its digital transformation, one of them is through services and banking products provided by digibank by DBS. ""Undeniably, technology makes things easy for us in various aspects, especially in doing daily activities. Knowledge of digital banking and various banking services is crucial for customers in choosing solutions for their financial needs. It is important for you to make the right choice of banking products and services that meet your needs. It will be even better if the banking products are not just a tool or a facility for transactional needs but also an investment,"" said Leonardo Koesmanto, DBS Indonesia Head of Digital Banking. ""Technology makes things easy for us and enables us to conduct all banking activities via our mobile devices. This is in line with our mission of Live more, Bank less to help customers enjoy life better and to not be bothered by complicated banking matters.

DBS partners Halcyon to set up HeveaConnect - a digital trading marketplace for sustainable rubber,17 Dec 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_Halcyon_to_set_up_HeveaConnect_a_digital_trading_marketplace_for_sustainable_rubber, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank Ltd (DBS) and Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (Halcyon) today announced a partnership to launch a digital marketplace for the trading of sustainably processed natural rubber [1] . DBS has also taken a minority stake in HeveaConnect, as part of the bank’s commitment towards supporting sustainable business practices. The HeveaConnect digital marketplace aims to connect natural rubber stakeholders such as farmers, rubber producers and tyre manufacturers in an integrated ecosystem, offering a convenient one-stop shop for participants in the natural rubber supply chain. Through the digital marketplace, natural rubber producers and consumers are able to track pricing and supply information and transact directly on HeveaConnect, promoting greater price transparency in the industry. Other offerings provided also include access to value-added services such as financing, insurance and logistics. Mr Robert Meyer, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Halcyon said, “We are pleased to collaborate with DBS as our key banking partner for HeveaConnect. DBS’s successful digital strategy and approach to financing fits with our digitisation strategy to make a difference in the natural rubber industry. HeveaConnect will not only be able to promote greater price transparency in the natural rubber market, but will also serve as an all-inclusive platform for farmers, producers, tyre manufacturers, as well as facilitators such as financial institutions, logistics and warehousing suppliers. Halcyon is first adopter as a natural rubber producer and we are also in discussion with our tyre customers to come onboard.” DBS-Halcyon partnership offers the scale required to effect change to the rubber industry As the world’s leading integrated natural rubber player, Halcyon has the supply and customer networks in place to provide the scale needed to help transition the global natural rubber industry which is currently heavily reliant on traditional paper-based processes into a unified digital marketplace. HeveaConnect will also be the exclusive platform for the sale of HEVEAPRO-sustainably certified TSR [2] to the global tyre industry, which consumes about 75% of the world’s natural rubber. In turn, DBS which has strong expertise and a proven track record in digitalisation and innovation in the banking industry is well positioned to provide trade financing and financial advisory to participants on HeveaConnect. As the digital marketplace’s main banking partner, DBS will offer services such as working capital financing, trade and commodity financing for buyers, and financing to smallholder rubber producers which previously may not have ready access to banking credit facilities. Mr Raof Latiff, Head of Digital, Institutional Banking, DBS Bank, said, “Building industry ecosystems that offer an enhanced customer experience continue to be a key focus in our business. As the bank with the world’s largest API platform in the banking industry, we continuously explore new ways to harness our digital capabilities to help our customers solve their business challenges. By integrating our APIs to facilitate trade financing to both upstream and downstream rubber players through HeveaConnect, we are also able to deepen our understanding of our customers’ needs, allowing us to provide innovative advice to best position their businesses for a sustainable future. We are pleased to be part of Halcyon’s ambition to be the leading provider of sustainable natural rubber.” HeveaConnect is targeted for launch globally in the first quarter of 2019 and there are ongoing discussions with other natural rubber producers, consumers and partners to be onboarded onto the digital marketplace. HeveaConnect first step towards encouraging a shift towards more sustainable rubber practices To help promote more sustainable practices in the rubber industry, Halcyon will inject the intellectual property rights of its sustainable natural rubber processing standards, HEVEAPRO, into the digital marketplace. In turn, only HEAVEAPRO rubber will be transacted on HeveaConnect, with the aim of encouraging a global push towards a more sustainable rubber industry. Ongoing efforts are also being carried out by Halcyon to expand HEVEAPRO standards to include the tracking of sustainable practices in rubber plantations and smallholders’ rubber plots (HeveaGrow) and promote traceability requirements in the sourcing of natural rubber (HeveaTrace). For instance, the natural rubber industry currently faces traceability challenges due to a highly fragmented supply base, comprising millions of farmers. However, with HeveaConnect, once the farmers are onboard the digital marketplace, all participants on the supply chain will be able to trace where each batch of natural rubber is sourced from, and if they are grown responsibly. [1] Natural rubber is the raw material obtained from the latex sap of rubber trees. [2] HEVEAPRO-certified TSR is Halcyon’s range of sustainably processed rubber, produced to meet best-in-class industrial and quality standards, occupational health and safety and supply chain security.

DBS partners China Capital Logistic and Wanxiang to launch an end-to-end blockchain trade platform for the automotive industry,17 Dec 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_China_Capital_Logistic_and_Wanxiang_to_launch_an_end_to_end_blockchain_trade_platform_for_the_automotive_industry," Singapore, China ","- DBS Bank today announced that it has partnered with one of China’s largest automotive logistics companies, China Capital Logistic Co. Ltd (CCL) [1] , and leading blockchain provider, Wanxiang Blockchain (Wanxiang), to launch an automotive blockchain platform (blockchain platform), connecting car manufacturers, exporters, logistics carriers and car dealerships. Named YunLianMeng, which means “Logistics Supply-Chain Connect” in Mandarin, the blockchain platform aims to provide CCL’s supply chain network with greater efficiency, cost savings and transparency. The blockchain platform will also facilitate integrated trade financing from DBS, giving participants easy access to financing on-the-go. This will be especially beneficial to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which previously would not have access to the bank’s credit facilities. Neil Ge, CEO of DBS China, said, “Developing solutions that solve our customers’ business pain-points is our objective, and we’ve learnt that the best way to do that is through collaboration. By partnering with key industry leaders, we were able to tap on each other’s expertise and networks to develop a blockchain platform with the scale and reach to make a meaningful impact to the automotive industry in China [2] .” With YunLianMeng, all participants along the supply chain will be able to access data on their order and delivery status in real-time. This enables transactions to be completed seamlessly, promoting faster order turnarounds and greater transparency. For instance, shipment carriers are able to receive and accept e-shipment orders through YunLianMeng. Thereafter, end customers, such as car dealerships, will be prompted through the blockchain platform to acknowledge the delivery order and log the delivery status of the goods once they are received. All information posted on the blockchain platform will then be provided to relevant participants, building trust and transparency across the supply chain. In addition, YunLianMeng also serves as a secure information repository by ensuring all confidential data is protected and restricted to authorised parties only. Financing-wise, DBS evaluates and disburses trade financing to participants based on digital data stored on YunLianMeng. This removes the need for paper-based supporting documents, cutting short the credit approval process. This means that participants on the blockchain platform get to enjoy a shorter working capital cycle which translates to savings in supply chain costs. Since YunLianMeng’s launch in December, DBS has already successfully processed and disbursed the first trade financing request to an SME vendor on YunLianMeng. [1] A logistics subsidiary of Beijing Automotive Group [2] China produced 21 million passenger cars in 2015, ranking it the first among countries with the largest production of passenger cars.

It will see 500 ITE College West students trained on the basics of cyber safety, with the students in turn educating their peers and community to increase impact and awareness. Additionally, DBS will run a cyber wellness-themed awareness campaign across the bank’s social media platforms that leverages on education materials provided by MLC and Help123 [1] – a one-stop platform for youth cyber wellness issues initiated by NCSS – to reach out to the rest of the community. As one of the world’s most tech-savvy countries, Singapore has also been witnessing a rise in cyber threats. [2] In a recent and latest survey on the issue, three in four youths in Singapore admitted to being bullied online, and almost all of the victims did not inform their parents. [3] A recent survey of Asian parents also indicate that 79% have or know a child that has been threatened with physical harm while playing online games specifically on websites or on social media. [4] The partnership seeks to counter this rise by teaching the students how to protect themselves in cyberspace and empower them to take responsibility for their own cyber well-being. The training course, which is developed and facilitated by service providers of Help123, namely Fei Yue Community Services and TOUCH Community Services, will also cover related topics such as cyber bullying and online privacy, and impart practical tips on preventing identity theft and the handling of online content. In addition, through education materials on cyber wellness by MLC and Help123 made available on DBS’ social media platforms, the partnership seeks to promote cyber wellness awareness to the rest of the community, in particular youths, parents and educators. Said Goh Mong Song, Principal of ITE College West, “ITE College West is happy to be a partner in this CyberSmart Partnership Programme. The knowledge gained from the workshops will benefit our students and further raise their level of awareness of cyber bullying and identity theft.

Lock Wai Han, Chairman of the Media Literacy Council said, “We are glad to partner DBS on this programme to raise awareness of online risks, which includes cyber-bullying, identity theft, scams and fake news, which are of critical importance given the pervasive use of digital devices among Singaporeans today. We hope that the incorporation of MLC’s resources within this programme will help to bring more attention to these issues.” Said Pearlyn Phau, Deputy Group Head of Wealth Management and Consumer Banking at DBS, “With usage of online devices such as smartphones among the young on the rise, the need to educate them on the risks of social media and other online platforms becomes even more pressing. We at DBS hope to make a difference within our communities with this partnership. We aim to reach those who are vulnerable to online hostility and security threats and let them know that there are tangible actions they can take to protect themselves.” 500 ITE students will also be given a free one-year CyberSmart insurance policy by DBS.

"DBS announces senior-level appointments, grooms talent from within",13 Nov 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_announces_senior_level_appointments_grooms_talent_from_within," Singapore, Regional ","- Underscoring its commitment to grooming talent from within, DBS Group Holdings today announced several senior-level organisational appointments that will take effect over the course of the next few months. Shee Tse Koon, presently DBS’ Group Head of Strategy and Planning, will take over as Singapore Country Head from 1 December 2018. Sim S. Lim, presently DBS’ Singapore Country Head, will succeed Tan Su Shan as Group Head of Consumer Banking (CBG) & Wealth Management from 1 January 2019 Tan Su Shan, presently Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, will succeed Jeanette Wong as Group Head of Institutional Banking (IBG) from 1 February 2019. This is to allow for a smooth transition ahead of Wong’s plans to retire on 1 March 2019. Wong served as Chief Financial Officer from 2003 to 2008. In 2008, she moved on to her current role as Group Head of IBG. Under her leadership, DBS has built one of the most successful corporate and institutional franchises in the region, most evident in the results of the annual Greenwich surveys. Over the years, DBS’ Global Transaction Banking and SME businesses have also grown from strength to strength. In 2018, DBS was named Global SME Bank of the Year by International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank Group. In a survey by Euromoney, DBS also came in No. 1 for customer satisfaction in the world of cash management – globally.  Tan joined DBS in June 2010 as Group Head of Wealth Management, before taking on an expanded portfolio which also comprised oversight of Consumer Banking. While she is best known for her outstanding leadership in private banking, in the course of her career, she has also had stints in investment banking and institutional sales. In her new role, some of her focus areas will include strengthening CBG, Private Banking & IBG connectivity, enabling DBS to further solidify its “one-bank” customer proposition. She will also continue to drive IBG’s digital agenda and focus in customer experience.  Lim, a 35-year banking veteran, joined DBS in September 2010 as Country Head, DBS Singapore, a then newly-created role. Over the years, he has built a robust country management team and process for Singapore, and helped provide direction for DBS Vickers, as well as the bank’s operations in Japan and Thailand. During this period, he has also gained good experience in the consumer and payments space, which will serve him well in his new role. Shee brings with him almost 25 years of banking experience, and including 22 years at Standard Chartered Bank, which spanned front and back office roles, and included stints in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Prior to joining DBS in September 2016, he was Country Head of Standard Chartered Indonesia. As Group Head of Strategy and Planning in DBS, he has been key in helping to flesh out the bank’s strategies for SME as well as growth markets, and in building out its ecosystems agenda.  Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “Jeanette first began discussing with me the prospect of stepping down a few years ago. I was able to persuade her to stay on as I firmly believed that the bank needed her leadership to guide us on a critical part of our journey. Although there is no perfect time, with the IBG’s stellar accomplishments, I believe that this is an appropriate juncture to finally accede to Jeanette’s request to step down, pursue her other passions and smell the roses.” “This will also enable us to continue to provide more development opportunities to our senior team and further deepen our bench strength. Sim, Su Shan and Tse Koon have proven to be very capable leaders, and I have no doubt that they will continue to excel in their new roles and take the business to greater heights.” [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS to launch Singapore’s first mobile-based QR payment collection solution to improve cash flows for SMEs,08 Nov 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_launch_Singapores_first_mobile_based_QR_payment_collection_solution_to_improve_cash_flows_for_SMEs, Singapore ,"- In an all-out push to get small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to adopt digital payment solutions, DBS will be launching Singapore’s first mobile-based QR payment collection solution that will enable SMEs to receive funds instantly from their customers and vendors. The solution named DBS MAX will be available to all DBS SME and corporate customers from 26 November. According to the 2017 SME Development survey, more than one in three SMEs in Singapore face finance-related issues. Of these, more than eight in 10 attribute their finance woes to cash flow issues resulting from delays in customer and vendor payments. DBS MAX addresses these concerns by enabling SMEs to receive payment from their customers and vendors through a mobile app in real-time. This does away with the need for businesses to wait two working days for cheques and credit card payments to be cleared. SMEs, in turn, enjoy better cash flow and benefit from a more efficient working capital cycle. Jasmin Ng, Group Head of Cash Product Management at DBS Bank, said, “Cash flow is the lifeblood of a SME. It is also critical to their success and overall viability. Apart from developing solutions to help our clients deliver an enhanced customer experience, we also look at ways to optimise their cash flows and improve their working capital management. This is important as SMEs form the backbone of Singapore’s economy, employing two-thirds of our workforce and contributing more than half of our GDP.” How DBS MAX works DBS MAX was designed to be easy for a busy SME owner or frontline staff to understand and adopt in four simple steps. Once the DBS MAX app is installed onto their business’ mobile device, all a business owner and/or employee needs to do is to generate a QR code on his/her mobile device before letting the customer scan it, and the transaction is complete when a payment notification is received. The funds received from the transaction would then be credited to the business’ bank account instantly, and all sales will be automatically consolidated in a report at the end of each day.  Key benefits to SMEs • Removes the need for payment terminals and automates book-keeping.  As it is designed as a mobile app, DBS MAX removes the need for different physical payment terminals at payment counters, allowing SMEs, especially those in the retail and services industries, to better utilise their counter space with promotional goods and special offers. For businesses with multiple outlets across Singapore, DBS MAX also updates their headquarters of funds received in real-time across the entire franchise. All sales information is also collated into an end-day report, automating the book-keeping process for SMEs. Ms Wong Mee Ching, Director, Cristofori Music Pte Ltd, said, “We currently have in place numerous point-of-sale terminals at our customer counters in each school. With DBS MAX, we can eliminate all that clutter and save on the rental cost of physical payment terminals. The automated end-of-day reconciliation is also a key benefit that we are looking forward to. That way, our centre managers can spend more time talking to their customers and less time on administrative duties.” • Provides SME owners with flexibility on-the-go.  When SMEs face a sudden surge in customer traffic due to special offers or when their business takes them to a trade fair, they can simply download the DBS MAX app onto their mobile device to open up an additional counter instantly, wherever they are. This provides them with the flexibility to scale up their point-of-sale counters instantly, at no cost. Notably, travel agencies are expected to be a key beneficiary of DBS MAX as they frequently participate in offsite travel fairs where it can be cumbersome to set up and rent physical payment terminals. Leading Singapore-based travel agency, Chan Brothers Travel Pte Ltd, said, “We think that DBS MAX is a truly mobile solution which is not tied down by wires or terminals and allows us to be creative with how we complete transactions with our customers. Especially for events like travel fairs, where speed and convenience are key, we foresee ourselves delivering an enhanced customer experience so that our customers can get onboard their dream vacation even faster. We look forward to getting onboard when the solution goes live this month.” • Integrated with PayNow.  As DBS MAX is integrated with PayNow, the majority of Singapore consumers and businesses can simply scan and make payment to SMEs with ease. Solution developed by harnessing SME customer feedback During the pilot phase of the DBS MAX project, the bank enrolled close to 1,000 businesses with the objective of gathering their feedback to create an easy-to-use payment collection solution. One pilot participant is homegrown SME, Happy Fish Swim School, which offers swimming lessons to children and adults of all ages. Mr Jay Tan Jian Yong, Director and Founder of Happy Fish, said, “DBS worked with us to understand the pain-points in our business during the process of designing DBS MAX. Our usual mode of payment collection was done via bank transfers and cash, which can be a hassle for our customers. But with DBS MAX, we are now able to collect payments instantly, helping us improve our cash flow and automatically reconcile our books at the end of each day, which is a win-win for us. The solution also reduced the administrative nature of manual payments so that our staff can focus more on providing a better service experience to our customers.” To find out more about how DBS MAX has benefited Happy Fish, watch this.  Next steps Following the launch of DBS MAX in Singapore later this month, the bank will roll out the solution in its next largest market, Hong Kong, by December this year. The objective is to reach over 6,000 SMEs over the next six months, with plans to implement the solution in the bank’s other key markets in the coming year. To experience DBS MAX, DBS will also be offering demonstrations on how the solution works at its booth at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Wednesday, 14 November.

This is the second global award DBS has won this year for its SME banking franchise. The awards jury commended DBS for the robust regional growth of its SME franchise.

In addition, the jury highlighted DBS’ use of digital technology to improve the SME customer experience and expand its customer base in a robust competitive landscape. Matthew Gamser, CEO of the SME Finance Forum, said, “The Global SME Finance awards celebrate the best-in-class financial institutions and fintechs that have achieved remarkable results in their SME product or service offerings. Our winners are diverse, but they all share a strong commitment to helping small businesses in their markets with their dedication and innovative practices.” Receiving the Bank of the Year (Global) and Bank of the Year (Asia) awards further underscore DBS’ growing global influence, exemplifying once more how Singapore’s largest bank punches above its weight. Joyce Tee, DBS Group Head of SME Banking, said, “Winning the top awards in both the Global and Asia SME Bank of the Year categories is an honour. It has been challenging and rewarding to build our SME banking business into one with international stature, and we are thrilled that these efforts are being recognised on a global stage by our international peers. These wins, alongside Euromoney’s recognition of DBS as World’s Best Bank for SMEs, affirm the importance we place on adapting to changing customer needs.” DBS was founded in 1968 to focus on financing the industrialisation of Singapore. Over the years, it has supported the growth of many of today’s largest companies, in industries such as property development, manufacturing and shipbuilding. DBS today banks around three in five SMEs in Singapore, and the SME business contributes more than a third of the bank’s institutional banking income.

"DBS third-quarter net profit rises to SGD 1.41 billion, total income up 10% to record SGD 3.38 billion | 繁體",05 Nov 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_third_quarter_net_profit_rises_to_SGD1_41_billion_total_income_up_10pct_to_record_SGD_3_38_billion," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group delivered another healthy performance in third-quarter 2018 as loan growth, fee income trends and net interest margin progression were sustained. The business momentum propelled total income to a record SGD 3.38 billion, up 5% from the previous quarter and 10% from a year ago. It exceeded the earlier high in first-quarter 2018, when exceptionally buoyant markets and a property disposal gain had boosted non-interest income. The income growth drove net profit to SGD 1.41 billion, a 3% increase from the previous quarter. Net profit was 72% higher than a year ago, when accelerated allowances had been taken for weak oil and gas support service exposures. For the nine months, net profit increased 36% to SGD 4.31 billion. Total income grew 12% to SGD 9.94 billion, led by a 16% increase in net interest income and 8% rise in fee income. Specific allowances were one-fifth of a year ago as new non-performing asset formation declined. Return on equity improved from 9.4% to 12.4% due to a higher net interest margin, a normalisation of allowances and a more efficient capital base. Third-quarter total income up 10% from year ago Compared to a year ago, third-quarter net interest income grew 15% to SGD 2.27 billion from an increase in loan volumes and net interest margin. Loans expanded 8% to SGD 340 billion, led by consumer and non-trade corporate loans. Net interest margin rose 13 basis points to 1.86% in line with higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong. Net fee income rose 1% to SGD 695 million as increases in a wide range of activities were offset by a two-thirds decline in investment banking fees. Card fees increased 33% to SGD 185 million from higher customer transactions and the consolidation of the retail and wealth management business of ANZ. Wealth management fees grew 7% to SGD 292 million as higher bancassurance income was moderated by lower investment sales income. Transaction service fees increased 5% to SGD 162 million from a 12% rise in cash management fees. Other non-interest income was 2% higher at SGD 407 million. Net trading income rose 34% to SGD 354 million as Treasury Markets trading gains improved from a low base; treasury customer income was also higher. The increase was offset by a 60% decline in net gains from investment securities to SGD 48 million. Expenses increased 18% to SGD 1.48 billion. Excluding a fiftieth-anniversary staff bonus and other non-recurring items, underlying expenses rose 15% and the cost-income ratio was 43%, in line with first-half 2018. ANZ accounted for six percentage points of the increase in expenses. Third-quarter total income up 5% from previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, third-quarter net profit was 3% higher. A 5% increase in total income was partially offset by higher total allowances as there had been a specific allowance write-back in the previous quarter. Net interest income rose 2%. Non-trade corporate and consumer loans grew 2%, sustaining the momentum of previous quarters, while trade loans fell 6% as maturing exposures were not replaced due to unattractive pricing. As a result, overall loans increased 1% during the quarter. Net interest margin rose one basis point. While higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong boosted net interest margin by four basis points, the impact was moderated by a lower net interest margin from Treasury Markets activities and by the full-period impact of Tier-2 capital issuances in the previous quarter. Fee income fell 2% as an increase in loan-related fees was offset by lower investment banking and wealth management fees. Other non-interest income was 49% higher as trading income increased 56% from the previous quarter’s weak performance. Underlying expenses rose 3%, below the 5% increase in total income. Profit before allowances rose 6%. Nine-month total income up 12% For the nine months, total income grew 12% to a new high of SGD 9.94 billion. With the cost-income ratio remaining stable, profit before allowances was 11% higher. Net interest income rose 16% to SGD 6.63 billion. Net interest margin increased 11 basis points to 1.85% in line with higher interest rates. Loans expanded 8%. Fee income increased 8% to SGD 2.15 billion as higher wealth management and card fees were moderated by lower investment banking fees. Other non-interest income fell 2% to SGD 1.17 billion as a 68% decline in net gains on investment securities was offset by a 14% increase in trading income and by a property disposal gain. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 21% to SGD 4.20 billion from increases in all product categories led by deposits, investment products and cards. Institutional Banking income grew 8% to SGD 4.26 billion as income from cash management and treasury customer flows rose. Treasury Markets trading income declined 12% to SGD 580 million. Expenses increased 14% to SGD 4.30 billion. Excluding ANZ, they were 8% higher. The cost-income ratio was at 43%, in line with a year ago. Profit before allowances rose 11% to SGD 5.64 billion. Balance sheet remains strong Non-performing assets were stable at SGD 5.90 billion and the NPL rate was unchanged at 1.6% from the previous quarter. Total allowances of SGD 236 million for the third quarter brought the nine-month amount to SGD 505 million, with specific allowances at 18 basis points of loans. Allowance coverage was at 93% and at 174% after taking collateral into account. Deposits were 7% higher than a year ago and stable over the quarter at SGD 388 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio of 132% and the net stable funding ratio of 109% were both above the regulatory requirements of 100%. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio declined 0.3% points from the previous quarter to 13.3% due to the interim dividend payout. The leverage ratio of 7.1% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “Third-quarter business momentum was sustained amidst heightened geopolitical and economic headwinds. Year-to-date earnings per share is the highest in our history while return on equity is the best in more than a decade. As we celebrate our fiftieth anniversary, we are pleased to be named Best Bank in the World by Global Finance and World’s Best Digital Bank by Euromoney. We are well positioned to continue capitalising on Asia’s long-term prospects while navigating short-term uncertainties.” [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

Agrocorp taps into DBS’ APIs to launch blockchain trade platform for commodity trade,01 Nov 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Agrocorp_taps_into_DBS_APIs_to_launch_blockchain_trade_platform_for_commodity_trade, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced that it is the first Singapore bank to have enabled an end-to-end cross-border blockchain trade platform for a commodity supply chain network, comprising farmers, exporters, traders and end-customers. Developed in collaboration with global agri-commodity trading company, Agrocorp International (Agrocorp), and blockchain provider, Distributed Ledger Technologies, the solution aims to provide Agrocorp’s supply chain network with greater efficiency, cost savings and transparency via a one-stop platform. Benefits include being able to offer supply chain participants with real-time updates on commodity prices and delivery information, and trade financing approval for orders coming in from any part of the world. With the implementation of the blockchain platform, Agrocorp and its counterparties are also able to enjoy a more seamless and secure transfer of goods ownership and payments. The streamlined process also bodes well for cost savings, as it cuts Agrocorp’s average working capital cycle by about 20 days. For commodity trading companies such as Agrocorp, this means more time to focus on developing new supply and customer networks to broaden its reach globally. Mr Raof Latiff, Managing Director and Group Head of Digital, Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank, said, “Cash flow and working capital are the lifeblood of companies and blockchain opens the doors to new business opportunities with trusted partners. The blockchain platform solution provides not only transparency, but also greater speed with which the business and its vendors can transact and finance their cross-border trades. The traceability that blockchain provides also offers much needed security when dealing with a new counterparty.” To help foster trust between Agrocorp’s counterparties who may not be familiar with each other, the blockchain platform stores information on each party’s past business dealings with Agrocorp and their credit history. Prior to the development of the platform, the challenge was to manually keep track of the visibility, tracking, enforceability and commitment across multiple parties when executing a contract. For a start, the blockchain platform will connect about 4,500 farmers in Agrocorp’s network in Australia to end-customers such as supermarkets and restaurants. With access to real-time pricing and supply information, suppliers and end-customers are currently able to carry out ‘live’ transactions at any time and track the delivery of orders on-the-go, allowing both sides to better manage their stock inventories. Mr Vishal Vijay, Head of Business Development at Agrocorp, said, “Commodities has been an industry that has traditionally been slow to embrace technology. But amid an increasingly competitive landscape, more industry players are turning to blockchain as a means to broaden the reach of their business to stay ahead of the curve. The convenience that an online platform brings to supply chain participants also fosters loyalty within the network, which generates greater trust between parties over time, allowing each trade to be completed quicker and with ease.” Going forward, in the next 12 to 18 months, Agrocorp plans to broaden the reach of the blockchain platform from Australia to its other key origination markets, including Canada, Myanmar, Ivory Coast and Ukraine. The commodities trading company also intends to increase the variety of commodities traded on the blockchain platform from pulses such as mung beans and chickpeas, to cereals, cotton, edible nuts and oilseeds. In future, the blockchain platform will also have the ability to capture in-depth details about the source of the commodities, including the location and ownership of the farm that they are grown in as well as the farming practices employed such as the extent of water, fertiliser and pesticide usage. This provides end-customers a transparent view of where their goods are sourced from and whether they are grown in line with their sustainability objectives.  How Agrocorp’s blockchain trade platform works Farmers log into the blockchain platform to access commodity prices in real-time and register a sale. All sales and purchase agreements are subsequently stored digitally on the platform. Payment-wise, upon certain pre-defined trigger events (such as confirmation that goods have been shipped), the blockchain platform automatically triggers instructions to DBS via the bank’s API framework to request financing for Agrocorp and/or release payment to the farmer. This minimises manual intervention for financing and payments and adds to the agility and swiftness of the entire trade flow. At any point along the path of the trade, counterparties can upload and view trade-related documents on the platform in real-time. All counterparties also need to validate any changes to any contractual terms on the blockchain platform as an added safety check. With the blockchain platform, details of each trade and where the commodities are sourced from can be easily tracked and leveraged to achieve the company’s/vendor’s/buyer’s sustainability objectives.

DBS Hong Kong launches Startup Xchange to partner Startups for FinTech future | 繁體,30 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_HONG_KONG_LAUNCHES_STARTUP_XCHANGE_TO_PARTNER_STARTUPS_FOR_FINTECH_FUTURE, Hong Kong ,"- With the pioneering success of DBS Accelerator and an increasingly dynamic FinTech landscape, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) is enhancing efforts to enable and support startup success with the launch of a new Startup Xchange programme designed to exclusively match the bank’s problem statements to FinTech startups. Rolled out in both Hong Kong and Singapore, Startup Xchange will source the world’s best and most suitable startups to co-create solutions with the bank on a continuous basis to address business problem statements in real time. This model allows startups to tap into the bank’s networks to build a sustainable business for themselves over time. The startups will also be able to showcase their solutions developed for DBS and also name DBS as their anchor client while raising funds. Brit Blakeney, Innovation and Ecosystem Head at DBS Bank (Hong Kong), said, “Fostering a dynamic global ecosystem of collaborative FinTech startups based on targeted business problem statements, as well as opportunities, is key to helping us reimagine and shape the future of banking. Startup Xchange is a natural extension and evolution of DBS Accelerator, and is a win-win for both the startups and DBS Hong Kong, as we are able to explore and solve business ideas together in real time.” Since the successful launch of DBS Accelerator in 2015, over US$16 million in funding has been raised, with all of the programme’s startup alumni successfully securing funding support or expanding their business in Hong Kong as a result of their participation. DBS Bank (Hong Kong) has successfully completed proofs of concept with many startup alumni, including FinChat, Perx Technologies, HyperAnna and Squirro.

DBS launches startup matching platform to help the bank and its customers harness the power of emerging technologies,30 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_startup_matching_platform_to_help_the_bank_and_its_customers_harness_the_power_of_emerging_technologies, Singapore ,"- In its effort to reimagine banking and make banking simpler, faster and more secure, DBS Bank today launched a programme aimed at matching DBS and its corporate and SME clients’ problem statements to startups. The Startup Xchange programme is focused on four areas of frontier technology that will help businesses stay relevant in the long run. They are: artificial intelligence (AI), data science, immersive media and the Internet of Things. By harnessing the power of these emerging technologies, the bank as well as its clients are able to stay one step ahead of their customers, and fulfil their business and lifestyle needs in a faster and more seamless manner. For a start, DBS has launched the Startup Xchange programme in its two largest markets, Singapore and Hong Kong. Unlike typical accelerator programmes, Startup Xchange brings in startups to co-create solutions with the bank, thus addressing business problem statements in real-time. Since its pilot launch several months ago, Startup Xchange has successfully matched 21 startups with units within the bank (e.g., Human Resources) as well as the bank’s SME clients to solve business pain-points. This has resulted in the successful rollout of 10 emerging technology solutions to-date, with another 10 solutions expected to be launched over the next 12 months. In addition to helping DBS and its clients digitise their business, Startup Xchange also allows startups to showcase the solutions they developed for DBS, and to name the bank as an anchor client when raising capital with the investor community. One example of a successful Startup Xchange project is with impress.ai, a Singapore-based startup and DBS SME client that partnered with DBS’ HR team to create JIM , Southeast Asia’s first virtual bank recruiter. Once JIM was launched, impress.ai raised USD 1.2 million and had a five-fold increase in monthly revenues from the partnership, paving its transition from a startup to a more sustainable business. It is now working with 15 large enterprise customers, including household names like AXA, NTUC Income and Singtel. Bidyut Dumra, Head of DBS’ Innovation Group, said Startup Xchange is a win-win for both the bank and the startup community. “Startups sometimes have the brightest minds to develop the most cutting-edge technology solutions but they lack an anchor client and continuous funding. Startup Xchange is great as it helps the ecosystem of startups, DBS and its customers to commercialise emerging technology solutions to quickly achieve shared business goals.” CEO and co-founder of impress.ai, Sudhanshu Ahuja, said, “The mindset of the team at DBS is very forward-looking and everyone we have worked with has a similar mindset, where they value innovation and focus on the future of digital technology. Joining the Startup Xchange programme was the right next step in our journey to gain business momentum and revenue growth."" A DBS SME customer who has also tapped into Startup Xchange to deliver better customer experience is Zouk, one of Asia’s best nightclubs. Customers at its Red Tail Bar will no longer have to jostle through crowds and shout across the bar to get their drink orders taken. Instead, all they have to do is whip out their phones and tap into Southeast Asia’s first bank-led retail chatbot, Foodster. With Foodster, they can skip the queue by ordering and paying seamlessly via Facebook Messenger and DBS payment channels, such as DBS PayLah! and DBS/POSB cards. This solution was co-created through the Startup Xchange with fintech startup Every Botty. Since it joined the Startup Xchange, Every Botty has grown its F&B client portfolio and secured business with established names such as Da Paolo and Subway. The Startup Xchange comes at a time when startups are struggling to stay afloat. DBS research found that 78% of accelerators launched in Singapore over the past three years are now defunct as many startups had failed without the continued support from established sponsors and partners. An Ernst & Young ASEAN Fintech Census[1] earlier this year also revealed that less than 39% of fintech startups benefitted from fixed tenures at accelerators. These findings and the desire to make banking invisible led to the revamp of the bank’s earlier accelerator programme, DBS HotSpot, to create Startup Xchange. Startup Xchange is part of a five-year SGD 10 million investment made by the bank in 2015 to support the development of startups. Cross-pollination between DBS and startups for a Smarter Nation Startup Xchange is also part of DBS’ mission to become a 26,000-strong startup by providing employees learning and collaboration opportunities with startups, to encourage a shift towards design and agile thinking. Testament to the bank’s success in encouraging employees to adopt a startup mindset, more than 15,000 DBS staff have participated in design workshops, hackathons and other innovation-related initiatives every year. “One of the best ways to engage, nurture and grow the startup community is through sustainable programmes like Startup Xchange, but let’s not forget the other important piece of the puzzle: DBS employees, who will collaborate with the startups,” said Dumra. “Startup Xchange provides a platform of true collaboration by fostering a common culture of innovation through design thinking and experimentation for both startups and DBS project sponsors to achieve shared business goals. This will also help us in furthering Singapore’s Smart Nation ambition.” Startups who are interested in joining the Startup Xchange can find more information here – www.dbs.com/startupxchange .

"DBS makes foray into chat commerce with ""Foodster"" - Southeast Asia's first bank-led retail chatbot",25 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_makes_foray_into_chat_commerce_with_Foodster___Southeast_Asias_first_bank_led_retail_chatbot, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced the launch of Foodster – Southeast Asia’s first bank-led retail chatbot that allows customers to order and pay for their meals seamlessly via Facebook Messenger and DBS payment channels, namely DBS PayLah! and DBS/POSB cards. Developed by chatbot specialist Every Botty, Foodster has been test-bedded with seven F&B merchants around DBS’ Marina Bay headquarters to strong results. The initiative marks DBS’ foray into the chat commerce space. Chat commerce – also known as e-commerce using chat or messaging platforms – allows businesses to transact within platforms that already have a large and captive pool of users. With 77% of Singapore’s population on mobile messaging platforms [1] , chat commerce solutions such as Foodster allow businesses to literally become a part of the conversation by embedding DBS’ payments capabilities within chat platforms. In Asia Pacific, the chatbot market is forecast to generate revenues of around USD 350 million by 2024 – more than eight times that of the USD 41 million generated in 2017 [2] . “If instant messaging is the way forward for people to communicate, then we need to help businesses find a way to engage their customers on such platforms simply, seamlessly and invisibly,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS Bank. “We are aware that consumers today are more likely to have ‘app fatigue’ and have become resistant to downloading new mobile apps. And so as Singapore’s leader in payments with over four million cards in circulation and the nation’s most popular mobile wallet – DBS PayLah! with over one million users – we saw an opportunity to combine our strengths with Singapore’s most widely used social media platform.”  Foodster – How it works Upon logging onto Facebook Messenger, customers can search for participating outlets by entering the outlet’s name and adding a “Foodster” suffix (e.g. “Kopi Ong Foodster”). The Foodster solution offers a full menu selection, accepts customised food orders, and retains the user’s order history, so customers can easily reorder their favourites with one tap. The solution also automatically offers eligible customers discounts and promotions, which can be redeemed with their purchase. At check-out, customers can choose to pay via DBS PayLah! or DBS/POSB debit and credit cards. DBS has also enabled an “Express” option where after a one-time authorisation and set-up, customers will be able to pay for all future orders with one tap. Foodster currently supports seven F&B merchants in the Marina Bay area, including Gemstar, Kopi Ong, Local Coffee People, NUDE Seafood, Old Tea Hut and Omnivore. Upcoming merchants include Kopitiam and Holey Moley. Merchant benefits  Kopi Ong, which sells quick-serve beverages, was the first merchant to test the Foodster solution. Since then, the business has seen daily sales grow by 20% without additional manpower or space required. The Foodster solution was developed with Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms which allow it to become ‘smarter’ with every transaction. In addition, it allows merchants to implement targeted and personalised customer loyalty programmes on the platform with its rich data tools and analytics. Other benefits of the Foodster solution include: • Help merchants grow revenue by providing an automated and immediate service to consumers, without the need for additional manpower or space. Rental and manpower costs currently comprise around 47% of operating costs for F&B merchants [3]  • Streamline merchants’ product inventory and new menu/ item launches. Merchants can conduct customer surveys to help them better understand their customers’ needs, and contextualise marketing promotions • Reduce customer acquisition costs – Foodster leverages Facebook’s massive user base and can handle multiple orders at a time • Help SMEs digitalise easily and affordably – set-up is easy using DBS’ open banking APIs and requires minimal equipment “We see endless possibilities with Foodster’s predictive data analytics and smart learning capabilities. Merchants get an inexpensive yet wide-reaching solution to engage with more customers, which will provide a welcome uplift to their businesses,” said Soo. Said Kopi Ong owner Alfred Tan, ""The F&B industry in Singapore is highly competitive. To keep our customers loyal and coming back for more, we have to be able to offer customised orders and provide a personalised touch to every transaction. With Foodster, we can survey our customers on their preferences, which then allows us to provide contextualised offers. With its real-time order dashboard at our fingertips, it enables us to optimise our store operations and better manage inventory in anticipation of peak periods."" DBS and F&B SMEs To cater to the financial needs of Singapore-based retail F&B and food manufacturing companies expanding overseas, DBS has established a dedicated F&B coverage team to better serve these customers. F&B customers are now able to tap into the bank’s expertise in financial structures, cash management and foreign exchange solutions to help better manage their cashflow. In addition, customers can benefit from DBS’ Asian network, and its domain knowledge in areas such as rental, manpower and taxation in the markets they seek to expand into DBS has also supported the growth and development of F&B SMEs in Singapore and the region with a suite of digital products and services including: • DBS Corporate Multi-Currency Account, which helps manage up to 13 currencies in a single account and enables SMEs to manage foreign exchange fluctuations, as F&B SMEs tend to import a lot of their ingredients • DBS-Xero partnership, which simplifies bill payments for F&B SME customers so that vendors and suppliers can be paid on time • DBS BusinessClass, a global social network for F&B SME owners to seek business advice and opportunities • DBS TechMatch, a cross-industry, cross-border business matchmaking service in which the bank refers relevant tech solutions to companies in different industries, including F&B SMEs.

Bank DBS Indonesia Shares Tips for Startups at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018 | Bahasa,23 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Bank_DBS_Indonesia_Shares_Tips_for_Startups_at_Tech_in_Asia_Jakarta_2018, Indonesia ,"- Indonesia’s startup industry has attracted many international investors and companies thanks to the vast opportunity in the Indonesian market. This year, Tech in Asia, the biggest and most promising startup ecosystem in Southeast Asia, presented “Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018”, a conference that offered an opportunity for Indonesian entrepreneurs to expand their network, gain insights and learn about new trends in international business. Bank DBS Indonesia participates in the event as one of the main speakers in the ‘Make Your Revenue Forecasting Reliable’ session. “One of the things startup founders can do to make revenue forecasting more accurate is by managing expenses through cost efficiency measures. One example is the use of co-working space that is more efficient than leasing an office in an office building. Apart from cost efficiency, co-working space is also helpful in creating an opportunity to meet with other businesspeople to expand network, "" said Rudy Tandjung, Director of Bank DBS Indonesia. Indonesia ranks sixth in the world in terms of the number of startups, according to Startup Ranking . The latest data (October 2018) show that there are a total of 1,923 startups in Indonesia, placing the country sixth behind the United States (45,759), India (5,710), UK (4,812), Canada (2,397) and Germany (1,942). Minister of Communication and Information Technology Rudiantara said that the rapid development of start-ups has also boosted the economy and state finances. DBS Bank has collaborated with various startups in Asia and understands some of the biggest challenges startups are facing in managing their business. Among these challenges is making accurate predictions of business directions and ensuring that startups find best practices in dealing with them. Unlike businesses in general, startup founders often fail to make accurate and reliable predictions for managing expenses to increase profits. In the session 'Make Your Revenue Forecasting Reliable', Rudy Tandjung, Director of Bank DBS Indonesia, offers tips for keeping expenses low in agreement with accurate business estimates. ""Employee productivity and efficiency must also be considered. For example, if a startup has five team members, an accountant is not really necessary and they can consider using accounting software. Collaboration with big companies or banks is worth considering to meet the company's financial needs. The use of digital banking can also save money and time, which should be dedicated to company development. The selection of partner banks also requires careful attention. Startups need to strike partnership with partner banks that can give not only transaction benefits but that are also able to provide access for business development and network expansion, as well as provide industry and business insights, such as the DBS Business Class platform provided by Bank DBS,"" Rudy Tandjung added. DBS Business Class is a platform that helps entrepreneurs develop business and networks, receive news of the latest market trends, and gain exclusive access to a community of well-informed Asian business experts. Connect with DBS business advisors and attend networking events to meet key influencers in the business, including venture capitalists, DBS SME specialists, and industry partners from across Asia. Information about DBS Business Class can be accessed at go.dbs.com/businessclassid. 'Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018' was an annual conference held not only in Indonesia but also in Singapore and Tokyo that brought together more than 13,000 individuals from the Asian technology community such as startups, investors, technology talents, companies, government institutions, and more. The Tech in Asia conference showed trends and insights from industry leaders as well as various opportunities. *** About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS further entrenches its support of social enterprises in Singapore,10 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_further_entrenches_its_support_of_social_enterprises_in_Singapore, Singapore ,"- To bolster the growth of social enterprises (SEs) in Singapore, DBS today announced the launch of the DBS Social Enterprise Support Programme. SEs that sign on to this programme will have access to mentoring sessions by DBS’ senior SME bankers, banking and finance training courses at the DBS SME Academy, as well as better financing options. The DBS Social Enterprise Support Programme was created to address the top three priorities of SEs. According to a report by the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE) [1] , these priorities are improving their business model to achieve financial sustainability; sourcing for funding and; customer acquisition. The programme is launched in conjunction with the DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Summit 2018, where business leaders and social entrepreneurs gather to discuss how businesses can transform to create a new era of commercial and social collaboration. “Social enterprises have big ambitions to make a positive impact in their community, and very often they struggle with limited resources. In the past 50 years, we have supported the growth and development of many home-grown businesses. With that same passion, we want to support these social enterprises in their journey to create greater social impact,” said Joyce Tee, DBS’ Group Head of SME Banking. The DBS Social Enterprise Support Programme is built on three pillars – mentoring, training and financing. SEs will also receive a relationship managed account traditionally reserved for larger corporate customers. The programme will jointly be administered by the DBS SME Banking team and the DBS Foundation. Mentoring Over 28 senior SME relationship managers have committed at least of 8 hours a month to mentor social enterprises in their specialised industries. These industries include retail, F&B and healthcare [2] . These relationship managers will provide SEs with advice to improve their financials, technology infrastructure, human resource management, and better manage their legal, audit and tax requirements. To start, DBS will mentor the 12 social enterprises DBS Foundation awarded in its 2018 Social Enterprise Grant Programme [3] . Training SEs will have access to exclusive training workshops through the DBS SME Academy. They can attend classes on working capital optimisation, digital marketing and how to better manage their human resources and productivity. All 350 SME relationship managers will also receive training over the next 12 months to identify and advise SEs on their financial needs, how to obtain better funding and ways to improve their business model to achieve financial sustainability. Financing DBS pioneered the social enterprise banking package 10 years ago, but more than half of the social enterprises surveyed by raiSE said they lacked access to financial support. As such, DBS will continue to provide SEs access to virtually free banking services through its DBS Social Enterprise Package. With this package, SEs can open an account with a zero-minimum balance and enjoy unsecured loans at preferential rates. “Running a social enterprise comes with many challenges, and it is so important to find business partners who understand your goals, passion and purpose. I’m looking forward to working with DBS as we pilot our service and work to transform healthcare in rural communities,” said Ong Tian Cheng, co-founder of Yonah, one of the 12 social enterprises DBS Foundation awarded in its 2018 Social Enterprise Grant Programme. “DBS has been passionate about supporting social enterprises for years, and it is encouraging to see them deepening their commitment with the launch of this new programme. Building capabilities, mentoring and providing funding support to the social enterprises will be crucial to their growth and sustainability. This is complementary to raiSE’s work within the sector.” said Alfie Othman, CEO of raiSE. DBS Foundation was formed in 2014 with a SGD 50 million fund to signal our commitment to support the growth of social enterprises across Asia. Since 2014, DBS Foundation has provided more than SGD 4.7 million in grants to 101 social enterprises.

"DBS launches world’s first online simulation tool, Treasury Prism",04 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_worlds_first_online_simulation_tool_Treasury_Prism, India ,"- DBS Bank India today successfully debuted DBS Treasury Prism , the world’s first online treasury and cash management simulation tool for CFOs and corporate treasurers. Users are able to simulate various bank and corporate solutions on DBS Treasury Prism ( treasuryprism.dbs.com ) at no cost, and review potential opportunities that will maximise value for their enterprise.  CFOs and corporate treasurers often manage several accounts with different currencies and transaction flows across multiple countries. As a result, they often engage a few different banks to help create an optimal treasury and cash management solution. The process in doing so, called a Request for Proposal, is often time-consuming, unproductive and tedious. Through in-depth interviews with over 50 CFOs, corporate treasurers and finance professionals and using a human-centred design approach, DBS uncovered five critical areas to address. These problems include: Too much preparatory work to achieve an optimal solution Difficulty in monetising or quantifying the benefits and costs of solutions proposed by different banks No time to keep up with the latest regulatory, tax and market changes Too much effort to work with stakeholders on a new cash management solution Difficulty in implementing new and complex solutions DBS Treasury Prism was custom-built to address these challenges, by giving CFOs and corporate treasurers the ability to independently experiment with cash and liquidity management structures and analyse the relative benefits and costs. The bank-agnostic platform takes into account the regulatory and tax environment in the markets where the company operates in, and offers immediate and contextual insights to help them understand the implications that each solution has on the business.  Users can create simulations of account and liquidity structures across multiple markets and compare each solution through a quantified assessment of its cost and benefits. The combination of digital solutioning and contextual insights results in a value-rich experience for treasurers as they explore potential opportunities and solutions.  John Laurens, DBS’ Head of Global Transaction Services said, “CFOs and corporate treasurers increasingly come to DBS for digital advisory services and to co-create digital business solutions with their financial and commercial operations. The nature of these digital engagements have elevated the partnership between transaction bankers and treasury and finance professionals well beyond the conventional bank-customer interaction. DBS Treasury Prism is a product of innovation and customer-centred digital engagement. Finance and treasury professionals have therefore shaped the platform through ideation, development and beta testing stages and will continue to drive the agile development of DBS Treasury Prism.” Roshan Mathew, DBS India Head of Global Transaction Services said, “DBS Treasury Prism is an example of the revolutionary approach that DBS has taken towards digital transformation, both within the bank and in the solutions we offer to our customers. This bank-agnostic platform gives CFOs and corporate treasurers access to information they need in real-time and helps them simulate different accounts, and model liquidity structures in a range of currencies, taking into account, tax and regulatory implications in Asia, Europe and the US. The solution lives up to our brand promise of making banking invisible, and puts the power quite literally back in to the hands of the corporates”. Some of the key features of DBS Treasury Prism include: Building simulations and quantifying benefits Treasurers often receive multiple cash management proposals from banks; determining the best solution is challenging as the benefits are not always clearly evident. DBS Treasury Prism empowers treasurers by enabling them to simulate various structures for a range of international currencies, taking into account the tax and regulatory implications in over 20 markets including key financial centres in Asia, Europe and the US. Each simulation features an Optimisation Score derived from a smart algorithm that takes into account the interest yield and debt, tax, bank fees and corporate costs, helping users quantify the benefits of each structure.  The dynamic online platform is equipped with over 30 liquidity and transactional flow management tools, including bank solutions and corporate tools such as interest optimisation, notional pooling, instant payments, and payments and receivables management, all supported by real time insights. In addition, the platform has an 'Optimise' feature that recommends alternative structures for users to explore and consider.   Access to contextual insights in real time  Keeping up-to-date with the latest changes in regulations and tax is time-consuming and challenging. The platform solves this problem by pulling current tax and regulation updates in over 20 markets globally, providing users with contextual insights in real time as they create simulations. DBS Treasury Prism also features a Knowledge Centre with articles on emerging trends, new solutions and the latest market practices in treasury and cash management, giving treasurers a full breadth of information.

DBS reinforces commitment in sustainable finance with Asia’s first real estate sustainability-linked loan,04 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_reinforces_commitment_in_sustainable_finance_with_Asias_first_real_estate_sustainability_linked_loan, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank reinforces its commitment to grow its sustainable financing business by launching Asia’s first real estate sustainability-linked loan. A collaboration between DBS Bank and CapitaLand Limited (“CapitaLand”), the latest deal pegs the interest rate of the developer’s five-year facility of SGD300 million to a series of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance metrics. Chew Chong Lim, Managing Director and Global Head of Real Estate at Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank, said, “Sustainable finance has been driven by growing recognition that sustainability practices bode well for the business, as well as the wider environment and society. Fulfilling ESG ambition is also being shifted up the scale of importance among corporates, and DBS is working alongside our clients to develop solutions that can help grow their business while positioning them for a more sustainable future.” Andrew Lim, Group Chief Financial Officer for CapitaLand Group said, “Dovetailing CapitaLand’s ESG efforts with our cost of funding further demonstrates our commitment to embed sustainability into our business in the long run and is core to CapitaLand’s role as a responsible real estate company. With growing public expectations and deeper focus on sustainability, embracing sustainability is not only good for our shared communities, but also beneficial for business.” How sustainability loans benefit corporates Sustainability-linked loans provide a financial incentive to companies keen to improve their ESG performance. These loans are structured on the premise that ESG performance is one of the key driving factors of a company’s financial performance. For this facility, the ESG performance of CapitaLand is evaluated based on RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment (“CSA”), which is conducted annually. If the performance targets are met, the interest rate for part of the loan will be reduced, bringing down the company’s cost of debt. DBS’ commitment towards sustainability  DBS recognises its role in promoting sustainable development of corporates and the wider economy. In recognition of its efforts, DBS is the first bank in Southeast Asia and one of five Singapore-listed companies to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia Pacific [1] . Last month, DBS set up a USD100m Women’s Livelihood Bond Program, which will comprise a series of bond issuances targeted to positively impact one million women across Asia while providing financial returns to investors. The fund in turn will help support high-impact enterprises in South and Southeast Asia working in areas of financial inclusion, access to clean energy, and sustainable agriculture. [1] The DJSI Asia Pacific Index is made up of constituents which are Asia Pacific’s top sustainability leaders. Their ESG performance represents the top 20% of the 600 largest companies in the Asia-Pacific developed region .

DBS/POSB first in Singapore to provide instant approval for credit cards & DBS Cashline via MyInfo,02 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_POSB_first_in_Singapore_to_provide_instant_approval_for_credit_cards_DBS_Cashline_via_MyInfo, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today launched a new online application service leveraging the national platform MyInfo. The service enables new-to-bank (NTB) and existing customers to apply for a DBS/POSB credit card with instant approval, as well as open a DBS Cashline account online with immediate access to funds and related DBS Cashline account functions. Both services are a first in Singapore.  The service is accessible to the 3.3 million registered SingPass holders in Singapore [1] on both DBS/POSB internet banking and websites. Time savings for the customer are significant – it traditionally takes up to a week for NTB customers to receive their credit card or access to DBS Cashline. Application via MyInfo removes the need for traditional application processes and provides real-time application approval without physical documentation. Back-end operations such as Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes are also automated, while meeting MAS compliance standards.  To use this service, existing or NTB customers applying for a DBS/POSB credit card or DBS Cashline account can submit an online application via DBS/POSB internet banking or the bank’s websites, where they will be prompted to use MyInfo by logging in to their SingPass accounts. Upon customer consent, MyInfo will retrieve personal data from relevant government agencies to pre-populate relevant fields such as a customer’s official name, registered address and Notice of Assessment. “Our focus here at DBS is to ensure customers can access our services with minimum fuss – MyInfo allows us to do this without compromising on quality, speed, and accuracy,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS Bank. “MyInfo adoption has been rapidly increasing since the service was introduced in March 2017. Today, one in four DBS/POSB customers will use MyInfo for online application services when given the option, and we expect this to increase with our latest credit card and DBS Cashline capabilities. We look forward to rolling out more services with MyInfo by the end of this year.” NTB customers who choose to apply for a credit card with DBS/POSB will be notified of the approved credit limit immediately. They will also receive a DBS/POSB digibank account for internet and mobile banking as part of the application. Meanwhile, NTB customers opting for a DBS Cashline account will be signed up for a DBS/POSB digibank account during application, where they can instantly access, transfer and withdraw funds, as well as pay bills, using DBS/POSB’s digital token. NTB or existing customers can soon use MyInfo to open a current or savings account, and benefit from instant access to the bank’s full suite of banking services via DBS/POSB internet and mobile banking.

DBS – First bank in Southeast Asia included in Dow Jones Sustainability Index (Asia Pacific),02 Oct 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_bank_in_southeast_Asia_included_in_Dow_Jones_Sustainability_Index_Asia_Pacific, Singapore ,"- DBS is the first bank in Southeast Asia and one of five Singapore-listed companies to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia Pacific. The DJSI Asia Pacific serves as a valuable reference point for investors and companies and consists of businesses that have committed to corporate sustainability practices, and which seek to create long-term stakeholder value. DBS has also been named to the FTSE4Good Global Index for the second year running, having been the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index in 2017. The index is designed to identify companies that demonstrate strong environmental, social and governance practices measured against globally recognised standards. Said Mikkel Larsen, Chief Sustainability Officer at DBS, “As the former Development Bank of Singapore, we recognise our role in promoting sustainable development, including the transition to a low-carbon economy. This is reflected in our financing decisions as well as within our operations, where we aim to reduce our own environmental footprint. We are honoured by our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Asia Pacific and to be named to the FTSE4Good Global Index for the second year in a row. Being recognised by these globally renowned indices is a validation of the efforts we’ve made in prioritising sustainable development.” Said Manjit Jus, Head of ESG Ratings, RobecoSAM: “I congratulate DBS for being included in the DJSI Asia Pacific. Companies that compete for a coveted place in the DJSI challenge themselves to continuously improve their sustainability practices and we are pleased to see that the number of companies that commit to achieving measurable positive impacts continues to rise.” DBS’ inclusion to the DJSI Asia Pacific and the FTSE4Good Global Index underscores its commitment towards sustainable development. In 2017, DBS became the first Asian bank and first Singapore company to join global renewable energy initiative RE100 by committing to using 100% renewable energy for its Singapore operations by 2030. In the same year, DBS became the first bank in Singapore to launch a green bond and also helped close the world’s first social sustainability bond to be listed on a stock exchange, the USD 8 million Women’s Livelihood Bond (WLB).

Singapore-based IIX partners with DBS Bank to set up the Women’s Livelihood Bond Program targeting US$100 million,26 Sep 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Singapore_based_IIX_partners_with_DBS_Bank_to_set_up_the_Womens_Livelihood_Bond_Program_targeting_USD100_million, Singapore ,"- Impact Investment Exchange (IIX) – a global organisation dedicated to building a more inclusive world through innovative finance and support for high-impact enterprises – has partnered with DBS Bank to set up the Women’s Livelihood Bond Program (“Program”), a series of bonds targeting a total of US$100 million. The Program will fund and support high-impact enterprises in South and Southeast Asia focused on areas such as financial inclusion, access to clean energy, and sustainable agriculture, and aims to empower one million underserved women in Asia to transition from subsistence to sustainable livelihoods. Durreen Shahnaz, CEO and Founder of IIX, said: “Women’s empowerment is deeply connected with the resilience of families, communities, and the overall peace and prosperity of the world. Yet despite their role at the heart of development, women and girls across Asia continue to face structural constraints that trap them in conditions of poverty. This is where innovative financial structures such as IIX’s Women’s Livelihood Bond make a big difference - by providing critical capital to those who are breaking the cycle of poverty and enabling women to take control of their own livelihoods. Building on the success of our first Women’s Livelihood Bond, IIX is ready to drive women’s empowerment across the globe at a faster pace and larger scale.” Issuances out of the Program will be listed on a stock exchange and planned to be sold to investors globally. With the launch of the first successful bond in 2017, DBS Bank has returned as the official banking partner and sole placement agent for issuances out of the Program. IIX has also partnered with global law firms Shearman & Sterling LLP, Latham & Watkins LLP, and leading India-based law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas for pro bono legal services on the first bond in the Program. Clifford Lee, Head of Fixed Income at DBS Bank, said: “DBS is committed to creating social impact by championing innovation and social entrepreneurship in Asia. Our continued partnership with IIX is impactful and meaningful as we are pairing up with likeminded communities to bring innovative offerings to investors globally. As Asia’s economic fortunes continue to grow, awareness of sustainability issues is growing in tandem. As such, we expect to see greater interest for sustainable investment opportunities in the region as they not only generate positive financial returns, but social returns as well.” Advancing gender equality has been shown to have positive, broad implications for social and economic development, with McKinsey estimating a potential US$4.5 trillion in GDP to be gained in Asia by 2025. Despite this opportunity, women represent as much as two-thirds of the poor across the region. The first Women’s Livelihood Bond (WLB1) closed in July 2017, and is the world’s first social sustainability bond to be listed on a stock exchange. IIX monitors the financial and impact performance of the borrowers and provides regular reports to the investors. Aiming to impact 385,000 women over the course of four years, the WLB1’s first year impact numbers have exceeded the target goals. No securities under the WLB2 or any related series will be sold in a manner inconsistent with applicable law in the jurisdiction of sale.  Such securities will not be registered under the United States Securities Act, and any sales in the United States will be made only pursuant to an exemption from registration.

DBS wealth clients can now use WhatsApp and WeChat for banking services,11 Sep 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_wealth_clients_can_now_use_WhatsApp_and_WeChat_for_banking_services, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced the launch of DBS Wealth Chat, a service that will allow DBS’ wealth clients to interact, exchange ideas and transact with their relationship managers (RMs) via popular instant messaging platforms WhatsApp and WeChat. The bank is the first in Southeast Asia to enable this service for its clients. Developed in partnership with regulatory technology (regtech) start-up FinChat, DBS Wealth Chat leverages DBS’ best-in-class digital capabilities to allow clients to use their existing instant messaging platforms to access DBS’ wealth services while meeting rigorous compliance standards. To access the service, RMs can register interested clients in a private chat group with the bank. Upon confirmation, DBS will set up a unique chat group administered by the bank between the client and his/her RM. Once the chat group between the RM and client is initiated, conversations and file exchanges that occur within the chat group will be archived by the bank without any intervention required from the RM. The entire process is fully automated. At present, RMs need to ensure key client conversations take place via the bank’s phone lines, where they can be recorded. DBS Wealth Chat allows RMs to communicate with clients on the go, on their clients’ preferred instant messaging platform. This in turn allows for speedier service delivery to clients. The introduction of DBS Wealth Chat is estimated to save some 10,000 manhours on a yearly basis, while enhancing the ease and quality of RM-client interaction. “We recognise that customers today are inundated with different apps and services and decided to go where our customers already are – WhatsApp has upwards of 1.5 billion users, while WeChat has close to one billion users. Our aim is to provide banking services that are embedded in our customers’ everyday lives, while maintaining client privacy and keeping to our rigorous security requirements,” said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management of DBS. “With DBS Wealth Chat, we can now meet both the communication needs of our clients and regulatory requirements. We look forward to realising the full potential of this tool, and to introducing more industry-leading solutions to our clients.” In the first phase, DBS will begin to register and onboard interested wealth clients in Singapore on the service, where content such as DBS Chief Investment Office reports, research insights and ideas, and exclusive invitations will be shared. Additional investment-related transactions (such as trade placement) will be introduced progressively in 2019.

The grant will be used for the development and pilot testing of Yonah’s self-developed turnkey cargo drones, which will empower communities in need to overcome access barriers – sustainably and affordably. Said Karen Ngui, Board Member of DBS Foundation and DBS’ Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, “With the DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant Programme in its fourth year, we’ve been seeing growing numbers of young, passionate social entrepreneurs across the region creating innovative solutions for sustained social impact. From building apps that help the blind; to drones that transport medicines to far-off areas; to using seaweed and flower-based packaging solutions or AI to reduce food wastage. Being a purpose-driven organisation, DBS seeks to support these changemakers on their journey to building a better future for all by providing them with the tools, knowledge and networks they need to thrive and achieve greater results for social good.” Every year, DBS Foundation works closely with the SE Grant Awardees to scale their businesses and social impact, and they have shown commendable progress across Asia. In Singapore, DBS Foundation’s 2017 SE grant awardee Ugly Good which aims to reduce by-product wastage generated by the F&B industry through upcycling and building innovative business models around wastage, has advanced in their research & development and received positive market feedback for their self-developed cleaning agent. Another 2017 SE grant awardee, Caption Cube, which creates opportunities for inclusive employment by hiring persons with disabilities (PwDs) as transcribers for video captioning services has grown significantly since receiving DBS Foundation’s grant funding. In just over six months, they have hired more PwDs, grown their project pipeline and commenced a trial to enhance their subtitling technologies together with a research institute. In addition, their new live-captioning service for conferences and forums is gaining substantial traction. DBS Foundation supports social entrepreneurs across Asia in three broad areas. This entails: • Building awareness and advocacy for SEs through initiatives such as the DBS-NUS Social Venture Challenge Asia, annual DBS SE Summit, bootcamps, workshops and learning forums. • Nurturing promising SEs through incubation programmes, skilled mentorship and financial assistance. • Growing high potential SEs through customised support, advisory and funding, and engaging them as DBS procurement vendors. While the bank has been supporting SEs for many years, it stepped up its commitment to the growth of social entrepreneurship with the establishment of the SGD 50 million DBS Foundation in 2014, to mark Singapore’s 50th year of independence. To date, DBS has reached out to more than 28,000 SEs and supported over 260 SEs with more than SGD 4.7 million in grant funding. The DBS Foundation works in partnership with like-minded organisations, the public and social sectors, to promote the development of social entrepreneurship.

DBS named Best Bank in the World | 繁體,24 Aug 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_Best_Bank_in_the_World," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- In a first for a Singapore and Asian bank, DBS Bank has overtaken larger, more established banks to be named Best Bank in the World. The prestigious top award was conferred to DBS by Global Finance in its World’s Best Global Banks 2018 Awards. Receiving the Best Bank in the World award underlines DBS’ increasing international recognition and stature on the world stage, particularly for its leadership in digital transformation. In July, the bank was crowned World’s Best Digital Bank by Euromoney for the second time in three years. It was also named World’s Best Bank for SMEs. Said Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance, “The global economy remains in flux, with US-led trade disputes exacerbating uncertainty. The world’s best banks are forces of continuity even as they adapt to rapidly changing regulatory and market conditions.” “To become the Best Bank in the World requires a special combination of safety and innovation in today’s rapidly evolving financial services industry. DBS Bank is pointing the way to the future for the entire industry with its digital transformation, strong financials and good corporate citizenship. Southeast Asia’s largest bank, and most valuable company, continues to win new customers by using its own technology to make banking simpler and more efficient.” Since 2014, DBS has embarked on a transformation programme believed to be the most comprehensive for a bank, encompassing being digital to the core, journey thinking, culture change and a methodology that measures the impact of digitalisation on its bottom line. Its groundbreaking innovations in recent years include launching POSB Smart Buddy, the world’s first in-school wearable tech savings and payment programme. Last year, DBS rolled out the world’s largest banking application programming interface developer platform. On the community front, the DBS Foundation has mentored and nurtured numerous social enterprises across Asia. Internally, the bank has also inculcated a startup culture and mindset among its 26,000 employees, so they can deliver a kind of banking that is simple and effortless, enabling customers to live more and bank less. Piyush Gupta, DBS CEO, said, “As we seek to reimagine banking, we are gratified by the global recognition of our efforts. Receiving the Best Bank in the World award is a great honour and shows once again that Singapore punches above its weight. It is a moment of pride that we are honoured to share with all our customers, employees and shareholders.” [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

Do you want to start a business? Check These 5 Things You Need to Know to Start a Business | Bahasa,22 Aug 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Do_you_want_to_start_a_business_Check_These_5_Things_You_Need_to_Know_to_Start_a_Business, Indonesia ,"- Startups are gaining popularity among Indonesian youths. But what actually is a startup? A startup is a young company that is just beginning to develop and is still finding its niche in the market. Indonesia is among the top five countries in the world with the highest number of startups, according to Startup Ranking. At the beginning of 2018, there were a total of 1,705 startups in Indonesia, placing Indonesia at number four after the United States (28,794 startups), India (4,713 startups), and the United Kingdom (2,971 startups). Most of the founders of the startups are members of Generation Y. Interested in starting a business? Let’s review these 5 things you need to know to start a business. 1. Start with a Simple Idea Starting a business is certainly a big challenge. We can start a business with a simple idea related to our daily problems. When starting a business, don't get fixated with trends because there are competitors in business trends that are still taking shape. This means we must have creative, unique ideas to stand out from other startups. 2. Determine Market Analysis and Target Audience Analysis of the market and target audience is one of the important things that determine the success of a business. We must understand the needs that other businesses cannot fulfill and to exist as a business that can provide better services for the public. After determining the target audience, we can do market analysis, including an analysis of competitors and our target audience. Through market analysis we can monitor the development of other companies that are engaged in a similar business and their strategies. 2. Follow a Timeline Discipline is what leads to a business success. It can be achieved by determining what needs to be done and prioritizing what must be achieved in a certain period of time to measure business development. 4. Join Business Classes and Workshops At times, we feel the urge to start a business but refrain from meeting the urge out of fear. There are many factors behind our hesitation, such as a lack of understanding of the industry, the market, or even the steps that must be taken to start a business, resulting in a lack of confidence in starting a business. Joining classes and workshops on startups will help us learn more and get inspiration from forerunners who have successfully run their businesses. DBS BusinessClass can be one of the programs for those planning to start and have just started a business. DBS BusinessClass is a program designed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to help entrepreneurs develop their business through business support programs. We can hone in our skills together with business specialists and share our knowledge with communities across Asia. 5. Partner with Banks Starting a business actually requires mature ideas and strategies. However, a business will not run well without adequate financing. Making accurate financial forecasts to ensure profit growth is a common problem among startups. Therefore, partnership with banks can be a solution so that we can focus on realizing out business plan. In addition to the five things to consider in building a startup, human resources productivity and efficiency are equally important. A five-member startup won’t need an accountant and can use accounting software instead. A last resort to be considered is the use of digital banking for the company's financial needs to save costs and time that could be dedicated to growing the business. ""Some of the things that can be done by startup players in making accurate income forecasts is by managing business expenses more efficiently. One example is the use of co-working space that is more cost-efficient than renting an office space in an office building. Co-working space not just cuts cost but is also useful in opening opportunities to meet other business people to expand network,"" said Rudy Tandjung, Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia.  ***  About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS and Singtel join hands to give SMEs a boost in navigating technological shifts in the economy,21 Aug 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Singtel_join_hands_to_give_SMEs_a_boost_in_navigating_technological_shifts_in_the_economy, Singapore ,"- DBS and Singtel today reaffirmed their commitment to helping small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore to digitalise their businesses and keep pace with the technological shifts in the local and global economy. Through the nationwide 99%SME campaign that helps SMEs expand their business by digitalising their operations, DBS and Singtel will be enhancing the e-marketplace on the 99%SME portal next month. The enhanced e-marketplace will instantly connect SMEs, especially those without an online presence, to an e-commerce platform hosted on the 99%SME site. The enhanced e-marketplace will give SMEs who are unsure of how to tap into online sales channels instant access to an online “shopfront” where consumers can browse and buy services and goods across different categories from fashion and beauty products to electronic goods and even stationery instantly, all at the click of a button. This will also help SMEs to raise their profile and grow beyond Singapore’s shores to expand their customer base regionally and globally. With growing trade uncertainties on the horizon, a recent survey[1] of 220 DBS SME customers conducted in the first week of August found that seven in 10 SMEs said that e-commerce channels and solutions would help drive and maintain their business growth. Of those who did not think that e-commerce channels and solutions would help their business’ growth, the survey revealed that three in five of them did not have sufficient knowledge about digital sales channels and the resources to invest in digitalising their business. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said that SMEs are the lifeblood of the Singapore economy. “With Asia being the fastest growing region globally, SMEs in Singapore need the right programmes and resources to give them a chance to realise their regional growth ambitions. SMEs are operating in a sweet spot, at a time where their business can grow at an unprecedented rate. This is due to rapid regional economic growth boosting domestic consumption and digitalisation opening doors to new markets and customers.” Andrew Lim, Managing Director, Business Group, Group Enterprise, Singtel said, “With digital disruptions becoming more pervasive, SMEs need to urgently transform their businesses so that they can thrive in the new economy. Through the 99%SME initiative, Singtel and other partners have pooled our resources with the view of helping at least 10,000 SMEs jump start and accelerate their digital transformation. We will support Singapore’s SMEs to grow, transform and flourish in these rapidly changing markets.” Tee added, “To give SMEs a leg-up and encourage innovation, public sector partners and MNCs must collaborate and close the gap with SMEs to address technological shifts and also harness the power of technology to expand into Asian markets, grow revenue and drive economic and social development.” To help close the gap, DBS will be developing a B2B platform where SMEs can gain access to an e-marketplace to sell their goods and services to large corporate and multinational corporations (MNCs). This will be the first of its kind portal in Singapore. It will also grant SMEs access to supply chain connections, financing, and payment solutions that are usually only open to large corporates or MNCs. The development of the portal will also be supported by 99%SME partners Mediacorp, Mastercard and Singtel. It is expected to be launched by the end of 2018 and details will be announced in due course. A retailer who has benefited from the 99%SME campaign is Tony Moly Singapore. Tony Moly is one of the top three cosmetics brands in Korea, popular for their beauty products. Wilson Lee, Director of Tony Moly Singapore said, “The 99%SME movement has been pivotal to our sales revenue from online channels. Web traffic to our online channels has increased significantly since September 2017 and we are happy that we tapped into 99%SME to grow our business.” Another SME involved in the 99%SME movement is social enterprise Oh My Goodness!, which employs ex-offenders and persons with disabilities. Said Ramya Ragupathi, CEO and Founder of Oh My Goodness!, “Running a small business is challenging, but it helps to have the right partners who share our mission as well as additional resources to help us along our journey. We are excited to be part of the movement this year and are looking forward to both the courses provided by The DBS SME Academy – we’ve already signed up for the Regionalisation 101 class – as well as the boost to sales that the 99%SME online marketplace could bring.” This year’s 99%SME campaign was launched at the DBS Auditorium with the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Chan Chun Sing as the Guest-of-Honour. More than 200 SMEs were also invited to a closed-door session with one of Singapore’s business pioneers, DBS Chairman Peter Seah who shared his views on the financial fundamentals of running and growing a business and adapting to change and challenges. SMEs who wish to be part of the 99%SME movement can register their interest at www.99sme.sg . Workshops and training sessions on cash management, digital marketing, accounting and tax regulations will also be held from 4 September at various locations around Singapore.

Ms. Jasmin Ng, Managing Director, Group Transaction Services, DBS Bank said, “Changing perceptions and old habits are the key challenges for many new corporate digital initiatives. We are heartened by the results DBS has seen so far, with adoption rates for digital payment methods on an uptrend among our corporate customers. DBS has seen widespread interest in PayNow Corporate from all segments of our clients including government agencies such as Singapore Land Authority, insurance companies such as AIG as well as leading retailers and F&B chains.” Powered by IDEAL RAPID APIs, DBS corporate customers have already deployed solutions using PayNow Corporate and PayNow QR code for instant and end-to-end fulfilment. By automating the payment to credit confirmation process for PayNow Corporate, DBS is helping customers to embed PayNow in their business processes, reducing risks, enhancing controls and increasing productivity in the process. Mr. Tang Kwang Boon, Director, Finance & Corporate Services at Singapore Land Authority said, “SLA is happy to be one of the early adopters of PayNow Corporate to support our nation’s drive towards a Smart cashless society and economy. By availing this additional e-payment mode with strong support from DBS, we seek to bring greater convenience to our customers, as part of our continuous effort to improve service delivery.” Ms. Claudia Salem, CEO of AIG Singapore and Head of Country Operations Southeast Asia said, “Together with DBS, AIG Singapore pioneered direct payments for travel claims through PayNow this year and this marks another step in our digital transformation journey. We are proud of our joint effort with DBS, and to be the first general insurer to implement end-to-end PayNow capabilities for our travel insurance customers. We have plans to progressively roll out this payment service across our other products and services so that more customers can benefit from this convenient and seamless experience.” Mr. Ryan Chioh, Managing Director, Far East Flora, said, “Cash flow is the lifeblood of SMEs like us. I’m looking forward to the introduction of Corporate PayNow, because it will increase my cash flow and my team and I can be more productive. We can spend less time on administrative processes and accounts receivables, and more time on developing our business and delivering a better customer experience.” To prepare customers for the introduction of PayNow Corporate, DBS has engaged with clients over the last 12 months, training close to 1,000 corporate and SME customers. Notably, the investment in time is paying off as there has been a greater acceptance of e-payment solutions such as Giro, FAST, and now PayNow. Today, 92% of all payment transactions carried out by DBS’ corporate customers are done digitally. Since 2017, DBS has introduced a slew of innovative solutions as well as differentiated pricing structures to speed up electronic payments and funds transfer adoption among its corporate clients. They range from a complete waiver of monthly charges for usage of its corporate banking platform IDEAL, to dramatically reducing FAST pricing from SGD 5 to a low SGD 0.50. DBS also launched corporate bill payments via IDEAL earlier this year, enabling all its corporate clients to pay bills online. With these offerings, DBS has seen payments via FAST grow by more than 300% and digital payments increase by 25% amongst corporate clients. DBS was also the first among its peers in Singapore to launch its revolutionary API platform, IDEAL RAPID, creating instant payments and streamlined processes for corporate customers. _____________ [1] The seven participating banks on PayNow Corporate are DBS, Citibank, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered and UOB.

"DBS commissioned ""Sparks: The Musical"" to commemorate Golden Jubilee",06 Aug 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_commissioned_Sparks_The_Musical_to_commemorate_Golden_Jubilee, Singapore ,"- To commemorate its 50th Anniversary, DBS Bank commissioned a musical based on its web mini-series, SPARKS, which ran from 3 – 5 August 2018 at Capitol Theatre. The musical by Singapore theatre company Pangdemonium showcased Team DBS’ camaraderie and passion for serving their clients, as well as their trials and tribulations. It served as a tribute to the bank’s pioneers, as well as leaders and staff who had shaped DBS over the years. The gala show, on the evening of 4 August, was attended by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, as well as many of the bank’s leaders and employees from the early years, including S Dhanabalan, Ang Kong Hua, Patrick Yeoh and Ng Kee Choe. DBS Chairman Peter Seah, PM Lee and DBS CEO Piyush Gupta took a walk down DBS and the nation's history at DBS SPARKS The Musical The musical capped off the first season of DBS’ SPARKS, an award-winning 10-episode web series that followed a group of dynamic DBS bankers as they navigated the challenges and opportunities at work and in their personal lives. Inspired by real-life stories, SPARKS demonstrated how Team DBS is driven by a strong sense of purpose and the commitment to do the right thing. Since its 2016 debut, SPARKS has garnered over 150 million views and a slew of prestigious marketing awards.  Adrian Pang reprised his role as Chester Teo in DBS SPARKS The Musical In SPARKS: The Musical, Adrian Pang reprised his role as Chester Teo, a no-nonsense DBS banker who cared deeply about his clients, as he reminisced about his experiences -- personal and professional. The characteristics that Chester and his team embodied reflect the grit, gumption and purpose of the DBS people who made the bank what it is today.  Said DBS Chairman Peter Seah, “DBS’ beginnings 50 years ago were humble but its mission was crucial – namely, to finance the industrialisation of Singapore. And as time would tell, its vision was grand and towering. Propelled by a strong sense of purpose and belief, over the last 50 years, the bank has played a key role in shaping the physical landscape of Singapore, diversifying its economy and catalysing the nation’s development as a global financial centre. Sometimes, the initiatives pursued by the bank were groundbreaking, frontier-pushing. Oftentimes, there were no set paths. We had to find our own way to blaze a trail.”  “Today, we are not just a leading bank in Singapore and Asia but also the World’s Best Digital Bank. The last 50 years have been a tremendous journey, and we look forward to continuing to reimagine banking so we can continue to improve lives and livelihoods.”  Said Tracie Pang and Adrian Pang, Artistic Directors of Pangdemonium, “We are privileged to already have a wonderful partnership with DBS as Production Sponsor for our previous shows, and so it was a natural fit for us to partner and create this special musical to commemorate DBS’ milestone year. We ourselves have learned so much from the true-life stories of the many inspirational men and women who have shaped the incredible DBS story over the decades. SPARKS: The Musical is a fitting tribute to the past, the present, and future of DBS.”  “It has been an absolute joy to revisit this character (Chester Teo) on stage – singing and dancing Chester is a revelation – and also to explore and expand the DBS SPARKS world, while uncovering such a rich and layered history,” added Adrian Pang.  DBS, formerly known as the Development Bank of Singapore, was formed in 1968, three years after the independence of Singapore, with the express purpose of financing the industrialisation of Singapore. Over the years, it has financed a multitude of industries, from manufacturing to shipbuilding; led the way in property development including building the world’s tallest hotel at one time (Westin Stamford); and helped to take many of Singapore’s most iconic brands including Singapore Airlines and Singtel public.  Today, it is a leading bank in Asia, and recognised globally for its digital leadership. In July 2018, Euromoney named DBS the World’s Best Digital Bank for the second time, and World’s Best SME Bank. More information can be found in “The 50 Years”, a book that chronicles DBS’ Golden Jubilee and its mission to build the nation.

DBS continues to dominate as Singapore’s most valuable brand for sixth-year running,02 Aug 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_continues_to_dominate_as_Singapores_most_valuable_brand_for_sixth_year_running, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank continues to be Singapore’s Most Valuable Brand, according to Brand Finance’s annual “Top 100 Singapore Brands” report. With a brand value of USD 6.5 billion, this is the sixth consecutive year the bank has retained its leadership position in Singapore. DBS’ brand value increased by USD 1.1 billion from 2017, a rise of 20.3%. This was more than double the average brand growth of 9% among the Top 100 Singapore brands, and contributed over 45% to brand value growth across the top 10 brands in Singapore. According to Brand Finance, DBS is one of just three brands in the Top 10 to be rated AAA- in 2018, alongside Singtel and Singapore Airlines. Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, DBS Bank said, “As we celebrate DBS’ 50th anniversary, being named Singapore’s most valuable brand for the sixth consecutive year, and being recognised as the world’s best digital bank for the second time, is indeed an honour. The recognition is testament to our drive to respond to customer needs in a fast-changing world by embracing digitalisation and human-centered design thinking. It is also made possible by the dedication and enterprising efforts of our 26,000-strong Team DBS. We remain firmly determined to continue on our journey to reimagine banking and seamlessly integrate banking into the businesses and lives of our customers in Singapore and all around the region.” DBS also ranks first on the list of Most Valuable Bank Brands in ASEAN for the sixth consecutive year [1] . In addition, the bank is also among the top 40 global financial brands in the world, according to the ‘Brand Finance Top 500 Most Valuable Bank Brands 2018’ report. Samir Dixit, Managing Director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific said, “While DBS seems unshakeable as the #1 Singapore brand, the real test of brand strength and brand value growth for DBS is reflected in the “Top 500 Global Banking Brands”, where they are ranked 40th globally. This highlights their strong and steady growth and shows that DBS is truly a globally competitive brand and not just a strong Singapore or ASEAN brand. When people focus less on your geographic origin as a brand, that’s when a brand is truly successful, and we can say that about DBS.” London-based Brand Finance is an independent brand strategy and valuation consultancy. The Singapore Top 100 Brands report is published annually and incorporates data from all listed companies. Each brand is accorded a brand rating: a benchmarking study of the strength, risk and future potential of a brand relative to its competitor set; and a brand value, which is a summary measure of the financial strength of the brand.

DBS first-half net profit up 23% to record SGD 2.89 billion | 繁體,02 Aug 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_half_net_profit_up_23pct_to_record_SGD_2_89_billion," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group’s net profit for first-half 2018 increased 23% to a record SGD 2.89 billion. Broad-based growth in loans and fee income, as well as a higher net interest margin, propelled total income to a new high of SGD 6.56 billion, up 13%. Specific allowances halved, in line with non-performing asset formation. Return on equity was at 12.5%. For the second quarter, net profit increased 20% to SGD 1.37 billion, underpinned by double-digit percentage increases in net interest income and fee income. Business momentum over the quarter was healthy as consumer and non-trade corporate loan growth, underlying net interest margin progression and overall fee income trends were sustained. The results were moderated by weak trading income. First-half total income up 13%  For the first half, net interest income rose 17% to SGD 4.35 billion from higher loan volumes and net interest margin. Loans expanded 12% or SGD 35 billion to SGD 338 billion from growth across trade, corporate and consumer loans, including SGD 9 billion from the consolidation of the retail and wealth management business of ANZ. Net interest margin improved ten basis points to 1.84% in line with higher interest rates. Net fee income increased 11% to SGD 1.45 billion. Wealth management fees grew by an underlying 27% to a new high of SGD 631 million as investment product and bancassurance sales grew. Card fees rose 29% to SGD 327 million from higher credit and debit card activities as well as the consolidation of ANZ. A 12% increase in cash management fees was offset by a decline in trade finance fees, resulting in transaction banking fees remaining little changed at SGD 316 million. Other non-interest income fell 4% to SGD 761 million as a lower gain on investment securities was partially offset by a property disposal gain. Trading income rose 5% to SGD 595 million, with an increase in the first quarter partially offset by a weak performance in the second quarter. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management (CBG/WM) income rose 20% to SGD 2.76 billion from growth in all product segments. Institutional Banking income (IBG) grew 6% to SGD 2.78 billion, led by cash management income. Trading-related income for Treasury Markets (TM) fell 20% to SGD 356 million. Expenses rose 12% to SGD 2.82 billion; excluding ANZ, expenses were 6% higher. The cost-income ratio was unchanged at 43%. Profit before allowances grew 14% to SGD 3.75 billion. Second-quarter net profit up 20% from year ago For the second quarter, business volume growth and the benefit a higher net interest margin were moderated by a weak trading performance. Total income increased 10% to SGD 3.20 billion. Net interest income rose 18% to SGD 2.22 billion as loans grew 12% and net interest margin increased 11 basis points to 1.85%. Net fee income increased 11% to SGD 706 million, led by growth in wealth management and cards. Other non-interest income fell 32% to SGD 273 million. Trading income declined 23% to SGD 227 million as a flatter yield curve and wider credit spreads created trading headwinds. A lower gain from investment securities also contributed to the decline in other non-interest income. Year-on-year income growth for CBG/WM and IBG accelerated during the quarter. CBG/WM income rose 23% to SGD 1.40 billion, faster than the 17% increase in the first quarter, while IBG income grew 9% to SGD 1.42 billion compared to a 3% increase in the first quarter. The faster income growth for both businesses was moderated by a 59% decline in TM income to SGD 107 million, the lowest on record. Expenses rose 12% to SGD 1.42 billion; they were 5% higher excluding ANZ. If TM income had been at the average of the previous four quarters, the cost-income ratio would be at 43% instead of the reported 44%. Second-quarter net profit declines 10% from previous quarter’s record Second-quarter net profit was 10% below the previous quarter’s record due to the weaker trading performance and the absence of a property disposal gain. Business momentum was healthy. Net interest income rose 5%. Loans increased 1% in constant-currency terms as consumer and non-trade corporate loans grew 2%; trade loans were unchanged. Net interest margin rose two basis points to 1.85%. While higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong boosted net interest margin by four basis points, the impact was moderated by an increase in liquidity buffers given the uncertain market environment and by Tier-2 capital issuances during the quarter. Net fee income fell 5% due to a high base in wealth management fees and brokerage commissions in the previous quarter, which had benefited from exceptionally buoyant equity markets and investor sentiment. Card fees increased from the full-period consolidation of ANZ. Transaction banking fees also grew as cash management fees rose to a record. Other non-interest income fell 44% due to a 38% decline in trading income and to a SGD 86 million property disposal gain in the previous quarter. The lower non-interest income resulted in a 5% decline in total income. Expenses rose slightly by 1%, while profit before allowances was 9% lower. Balance sheet remains strong For the first half, non-performing asset formation fell 53% to SGD 551 million. Total allowances halved to SGD 269 million, with specific allowances for loans amounting to 16 basis points. Non-performing assets stood at SGD 5.87 billion, 3% below end-2017 and little changed from the previous quarter. The NPL rate was at 1.6% and allowance coverage was at 92% and at 173% when collateral was considered. Deposits rose 14% from a year ago and 2% from the previous quarter in constant-currency terms to SGD 388 billion. The net stable funding ratio of 110% and liquidity coverage ratio of 135% were both above the regulatory requirements of 100%. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio declined 0.4 percentage points from the previous quarter to 13.6%. The payment of the final and special dividends of 2017 in May 2018 was partially offset by retained earnings for the second quarter and by methodology enhancements. The leverage ratio of 7.0% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%. The Board declared a first-half dividend of SGD 60 cents per share, compared to SGD 33 cents per share a year ago. The dividend is in line with the guidance provided at the fourth-quarter 2017 results announcement. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “The record first-half earnings demonstrate once again the breadth and quality of our franchise, while the higher returns demonstrate the improved profitability of our businesses as interest rates and credit costs normalise. The industry accolades we were recently awarded, including the World’s Best Digital Bank by Euromoney for a second time in three years, attest to the strides we have made in delivering customer value. Amidst heightened uncertainty and market volatility, business momentum was sustained in the second quarter. While there are gathering clouds, the region’s prospects remain intact, enabling us to continue capturing growth opportunities and generating stronger shareholder returns in the coming quarters.” [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS India launches real-time digital crossborder payment tracking,25 Jul 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_INDIA_LAUNCHES_REALTIME_DIGITAL_CROSSBORDER_PAYMENT_TRACKING, India ,"- DBS corporate clients in India will now be able to benefit from better cash flow visibility through real-time cross-border payment tracking of all their commercial payments. DBS’ corporate customers will be the first in India to be offered real-time status of their cross-border [1] payments at their fingerprints. DBS clients in Singapore and Hong Kong were the first in Asia to be able to tap into this digital solution. Powered by SWIFT Global Payments Innovation (gpi), this solution will enable DBS’ India clients to experience the same transparency and speed for their transactions. Roshan Mathew, Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS Bank India said, “As with revolutionary products like UPI that transformed domestic payments, corporate treasurers have been eager to see innovation in cross-border payments and want efficiency and speed across all their payments. The DBS SWIFT gpi solution gives them online visibility to track payments across 62 gpi banks across the globe and this is set to increase as more banks come on board.” The SWIFT gpi launch is a significant step towards leveraging innovations into existing robust cross border payments infrastructure provided by SWIFT. A SWIFT survey [2] found that 54% of treasurers said they want real-time payments tracking, while 42% are looking for instant payments. With the new DBS SWIFT gpi solution, customers can now track [3] the status of their cross-border [4] payments instantly online without the need to call the DBS corporate call centre. By logging into DBS IDEAL, the bank’s corporate online banking platform, clients will be able to find out whether the full amount of funds has been received by the beneficiary, the foreign exchange rate applied, and where the funds are in the cross-border payment chain. In addition, customers can expect a faster turnaround time for their cross-border payments as banks using SWIFT gpi are governed by service-level agreements and are required to process transactions within four hours. Raj Bafna, Sr. GM Finance, Alkem Laboratories Ltd [5] said that the solution has benefited their payments processes. “The platform has enabled us to track payments in real time and brought clarity in the payment process” said Bafna. “By bringing real-time cross-border tracking through SWIFT gpi to India, DBS is setting a new standard in the way treasury functions are managed. Traditionally, transactions are routed through multiple banks before reaching the beneficiary, making complete trackability of a payment challenging, and leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs. These gaps are being addressed by SWIFT gpi through its real-time, end-to-end status updates, and the information it offers on the foreign exchange rate and the amount that will be credited to the beneficiary. I am confident that this will up the ante for corporates and SMEs in India and offer them tremendous value-add when it comes to supporting their supply chain, trade and cash management functions,” said Michael Moon, Head of Payments Markets, Markets & Initiatives, Asia Pacific, SWIFT. “DBS has been pioneering banking with innovative products and challenging every way banking has operated traditionally. The unique online tracking solution is a testament to that commitment,” Mathew added. *** [1], [4] Cross-border payments, which are not related to trade import payments (A2) are enabled for this feature. [2] The future of payments: a corporate treasury perspective survey by SWIFT and EuroFinance gauged the views of 300 treasury professionals from corporations worldwide, ranging from SMEs to global corporations in 18 different industries in October 2017. [3] The tracking on SWIFT gpi is based on a Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference number (UETR) assigned by the originating bank. This UETR enables real-time tracking of the status of the cross-border payment. [5] Alkem Laboratories Ltd. is one of India's leading Generic and Speciality Pharmaceutical Company.

DBS launches Southeast Asia's largest bank-led property marketplace,24 Jul 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_Southeast_Asias_largest_bank_led_property_marketplace, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced the launch of Southeast Asia’s largest bank-led property marketplace. It is also the first bank in the region to launch an online property marketplace that offers listings from both agents and owners. DBS Property Marketplace ( go.dbs.com/sg-propertymarketplace ) has partnered major online property listing platforms EdgeProp and Averspace to provide some 100,000 listings and will soon include listings from SoReal. The site comes with Singapore’s first home financial planner that helps first-time home buyers determine their “affordability” price range based on their monthly cashflow, calculated from both their CPF and cash deposits. The marketplace will also be able to facilitate end-to-end paperless transactions, from cheque-free payments to digital documentation. In addition, the site will provide all the essential services buyers need to settle into their new homes by partnering with service providers, including utilities; digital home solutions such as internet and TV services; renovation; cleaning and moving services. Following the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) announcement in June 2017 proposing to allow banks to operate digital platforms that match buyers and sellers of consumer goods or services, DBS became the first bank in Singapore to launch an online consumer marketplace with DBS Car Marketplace in August 2017, followed by DBS Electricity Marketplace in March 2018. The bank is uniquely well-placed in the marketplaces space as it banks most of Singapore – five million retail customers and six in 10 SMEs bank with DBS. This enables DBS to build marketplaces with robust ecosystems in partnership with SMEs and with the aid of consumer insights. In addition, DBS’ sites are among the most visited in Singapore [1] , allowing the bank to leverage its popular online channels to attract and redirect customers to relevant marketplaces for their lifestyle needs. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of DBS Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), “While it is still early days, we believe this represents a paradigm shift for financial services in the future. As the largest bank in Singapore for both consumers and SMEs, we can effectively work in each sector’s ecosystem to partner SMEs and build data-driven customer research and benchmarking tools. This allows us to provide one-stop solutions that effectively anticipate our customers’ needs across their purchase journey. Singaporeans are extremely savvy online shoppers – 96% of Singaporeans use their digital devices for research and information, and 66% for goods and services consumption at least once a week [2] – so we aim to provide holistic, thoughtful, and comprehensive propositions unique to the market, and become a meaningful part of their purchase journey.” DBS Car Marketplace ( go.dbs.com/car ) Since its launch in August 2017 as Singapore’s largest direct seller-to-buyer car marketplace, in partnership with sgCarMart and Carro, DBS Car Marketplace has attracted some 350,000 unique visits. The site has also facilitated transactions consisting of car purchase, loans, insurance and credit card applications as well as purchase of car-related accessories. The bank has expanded its marketplace to include six established car dealers: Alpine Group; Select by Performance Premium Selection; Inchcape Pre-Owned; CarTimes; Orchard Credit; and Dickson. The marketplace also includes services from VICOM Ltd, the largest vehicle inspection and technical testing company in Singapore. DBS Electricity Marketplace ( go.dbs.com/sg-electricitymarketplace ) Since its launch in March this year, DBS Electricity Marketplace, which allows consumers to seamlessly switch to new electricity retailers iSwitch and Keppel Electric, has attracted some 190,000 unique visitors – almost double of the 108,000 eligible Jurong households. This indicates deep interest from consumers in the potential switching of electricity providers and bodes well for the electricity liberalisation which will happen by the end of the year. DBS looks forward to introducing more electricity retailers to the marketplace then. APPENDIX Partner quotes DBS Property Marketplace Bernard Tong, CEO of EdgeProp said, “We are excited to partner DBS on this journey to deliver a seamless and consumer-centric property discovery experience. As the fastest growing property platform in the region, EdgeProp's goal is to help property seekers make informed property decisions by making information as widely accessible and as transparent as possible. We believe that great content, whether it is research, news, property listings or data, is meant to be shared. Our ground-breaking partnership with DBS offers a new opportunity to collaborate with one of Singapore's major institutions with similar values to ours in uplifting Singaporeans’ knowledge of property as a major asset class and creating shared value amongst all our business partners.” DBS Car Marketplace Sim Wing Yew, CEO of VICOM, said, “VICOM is pleased to offer our pre-owned car evaluation service - VICOM FIT or VFIT - at discounted rates for DBS Car Marketplace. Buying a vehicle is a big financial decision and no one wants to end up with a defective pre-owned vehicle. Our VFIT service will offer buyers the assurance that the pre-owned vehicle that they are buying is in a roadworthy condition.” Albert Pang, Managing Director of Alpine Group said, “Alpine Group is proud to partner DBS Car Marketplace. Having amassed over 35 years in the car industry, Alpine Group provides comprehensive services for car ownership, including workshop facilities. As Singapore progresses towards a smart nation, we believe the landscape is ripe for the digitalisation of our services. With the help of DBS, Alpine seeks to provide solutions for consumers with convenience and ease.” DBS Electricity Marketplace Janice Bong, General Manager of Keppel Electric, said, “As one of the pioneers of the electricity retail market, Keppel Electric is constantly innovating our products, so that we can offer better value to our end consumers. We are pleased to work with DBS to launch our electricity offers on DBS Marketplace which offers greater convenience to consumers.”  [1]  https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/SG (accessed 23 July 2018)  [2] Source: Ernst & Young, “Savvy Singapore: Decoding a digital nation”, 2016, pg. 28 [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS Hong Kong sparks the future with “Live More” | 繁體,16 Jul 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_HONG_KONG_SPARKS_THE_FUTURE_WITH_LIVE_MORE, Hong Kong ,"- Reflecting a bold positioning that embodies and personifies the future of banking, DBS Hong Kong today unveiled “Live more, Bank less”, a new brand promise that seeks to deliver banking so simple, seamless and invisible, that customers have more time to spend on the people and things they care about. With the digital revolution, banking is being fundamentally redefined. DBS, which turns 50 today, and is newly crowned as World’s Best Digital Bank and World’s Best Bank for SMEs in 2018 by Euromoney, has spent the past few years reimagining banking, with a commitment to a new kind of banking that enables customers to live hassle-free with invisible banking, seize life’s opportunities and live larger than themselves, or “Live more, Bank less”. To “Live more”, DBS staff will each receive a SG$500 (HK$3,000) bonus this month as part of the bank’s 50th anniversary celebrations. As part of the new brand promise, DBS Hong Kong is kicking off the inaugural “Live more” day by offering the public free rides on the two Star Ferry routes running between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central, and Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai, for the entire day on Saturday 18 August. In collaboration with Swire Properties, lunchtime busking sessions at Taikoo Place under the PROJECT AFTER 6: Busking initiative are planned for September and October to help talented office professionals in Hong Kong fulfill their musical aspirations, and foster community joy and happiness. Live hassle-free with invisible banking Recognising that people’s lives don’t revolve around banking is at the heart of the bank’s digital transformation. This is reflected in our successful efforts to make banking invisible by transforming banking into a truly joyful customer experience. From our pioneering virtual reality DBS Home360 app for a seamless home buying process, and the power of personalised virtual banking at your fingertips via digibank, DBS Omni and DBS Remit, to our groundbreaking “Meet Online” Business Account Opening Service for SMEs in Hong Kong to easily open DBS business accounts without ever having to set foot in the bank’s branches, and more, our customer-centred design approach to a seamless, efficient and intuitive customer experience will help ensure we remain at the forefront of banking. Since 2016, DBS Hong Kong’s digital initiatives have so far saved an estimated 40 million hours in customer time, which works out to more than 4,600 years. Ajay Mathur, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group & Wealth Management of DBS Bank (Hong Kong), said, “We believe that banks tomorrow will look fundamentally different from banks today. That’s why we are deeply immersed in the digital agenda, whether it is changing the culture and mindsets of our people, re-architecting our technology infrastructure, or leveraging big data to make banking simple and seamless for customers. The fact that the bank’s digital initiatives helped our customers spend the equivalent of over 4,600 years on the things and people they care about is amazing, and shows we are truly making banking joyful and enabling our customers to ‘live more, bank less’.” Seize life’s opportunities Life is short, and time is money, especially given the breakneck pace things happen in Hong Kong. DBS Hong Kong’s continued investments in innovation and digital banking show our commitment to staying relevant to the changing needs of our customers, who are spending more time online and on their smartphones. With DBS iWealth, customers have access to sophisticated portfolio and performance analysis, as well as curated research and investment insights, at their fingertips, while DBS BusinessClass helps SMEs leverage a wide range of business opportunities by connecting them with a knowledgeable community of Asia’s business leaders, including venture capitalists and industry peers. Corporate customers can also take advantage of the real-time capabilities of DBS IDEAL RAPID, or Real-time API by DBS, which provides instantaneous transactions, as well as DBS Treasury Prism, the world’s first online treasury and cash management simulation tool, and more, to better seize life’s opportunities. Alex Cheung, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Banking Group of DBS Bank (Hong Kong), said, “As a leader in SME banking, we make it a priority to reimagine banking, seamlessly weave banking into the customer’s everyday life by being part of their ecosystem, and provide SMEs with the tools to help them grow their business. In doing so, we hope they can better manage their business, make more informed decisions, and ‘live more, bank less’.” Live larger than yourself In addition to embedding banking in the daily lives of customers, “Live more, Bank less” is about enabling people to live larger than themselves, so they can spend time on the people and things they care about. As pervasive as digital innovation is in the bank, sustainability has been at the core of our purpose-driven DNA. This involves providing responsible banking, creating social impact by giving back to the community through the bank, as well as doing our part for the environment and combating climate change. DBS Hong Kong is the first bank to provide a step-up fund to support the sustainable development of social enterprises in the city. We believe nurturing self-sustaining businesses that creatively and effectively address social needs, is our way of addressing the myriad social challenges associated with a rapidly-growing community in Hong Kong. So far, we have funded and supported over 50 social enterprises in Hong Kong, including nine our senior executives are currently mentoring. With DBS Hong Kong’s resources, funding and mentor support, and expertise in serving the SME sector, we help enhance the commercial viability of social enterprises while maximising their social impact. To encourage DBS staff to live larger than themselves and give back to the local communities, at least 50 People of Purpose volunteering initiatives are planned for the month of July across DBS’ markets, including six volunteering initiatives in Hong Kong. All the volunteering initiatives are focused on active ageing, education and the environment, to help address pressing issues in Asia, and are supported by our charity partners and social enterprises. Glendy Chu, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “‘Live more, Bank less’ characterises the way DBS works. It is about aspiring to do something purposeful with your life, whether you're in business, raising a family at home, or have a great idea on how to make the world a better place. At DBS, we believe you want to live life to the fullest and you want simple, smart and innovative banking services and products that enable that. People don’t bank to transact. They bank because they want to get the most out of life.” The launch of the new “Live more, Bank less” brand promise in Hong Kong will also include strategic out-of-home and online advertising, influencer marketing, social media engagement, and more.

DBS named World's Best Digital Bank | 繁體 | Bahasa,12 Jul 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_Worlds_Best_Digital_Bank_2018," Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional, Hong Kong ","- DBS Bank received global recognition last night as it was named the ‘World’s Best Digital Bank’ and ‘World’s Best SME Bank’ by Euromoney. It is the first Asian Bank and Singapore bank to win two awards in the global category at the prestigious Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2018. For the hotly contested ‘World’s Best Digital Bank’ award, DBS beat top-tier global competitors such as Bank of America and HSBC to come out tops. This is the second time DBS’ leadership in digital banking has been recognised by Euromoney as being the best globally, the first being in 2016. Said Euromoney, “DBS has shown the power of being articulate about digital banking and the bank has long since entrenched an entrepreneurial, tech-led culture which pervades every business line and every level of seniority. But being able to get into the details and explain how and why a digital path is one paved with profits? That’s a new and important step. “Quantifying exactly what digitalisation means for profitability – and it means plenty – is a useful tool not only for investors but the whole industry. The market is so impressed by what it has heard from DBS that it’s beginning to be revalued as a bank crossed with a tech stock.” To measure the effectiveness and pervasiveness on its digital transformation efforts, DBS is believed to be the first bank in the world to develop a methodology for measuring the financial value created by digitalisation. Through its digital value capture methodology, it has been able to draw up an effective business plan to drive digital behaviour among customers, making it simpler for customers to engage with the bank online. As a testament to its digital transformation strategy, DBS improved its cost-income-ratio from 45.4% in 2015 to 43% in 2017. Revenues have also increased by 10.4% over the same period. Meanwhile, the proportion of customers in Consumer and SME Banking in Singapore and Hong Kong that are digital rose nine percentage points since 2015 to 42% today. DBS’ ‘World’s Best SME Bank’ win validates the bank’s efforts in supporting SMEs in Asia through regional connectivity and digital innovation. Said Euromoney, “It is rare to find banks that offer comprehensive services to SMEs cross-border. Singapore is an exception, and DBS has made the greatest progress in our review period, taking the lessons it has learned in serving Hong Kong and Singapore SMEs and applying them in India, Greater China and Indonesia. “DBS has harnessed its digital excellence to provide convenience, speed and comprehensive solutions to small and medium enterprises. It is extremely well placed to assist the growth of these businesses from India to the Greater Bay Area, and it is doing so without compromising asset quality.” Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “Since our founding 50 years ago, DBS has always had a history of trailblazing and innovating. Five years ago, we envisioned that the future would be one marked by accelerating change; since then, we have proactively disrupted ourselves with a singular goal in mind: to make banking simpler, faster and better for our customers. In this milestone year, we are very honoured that DBS’ digital leadership is recognised as leading the way not just in Asia but the world.”  [End]  About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS Bank (Taiwan) Launches Real-Time SWIFT gpi Solution | 繁體,06 Jul 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_Taiwan_Launches_Real_Time_SWIFT_gpi_Solution," Taiwan, Regional ","- As a pioneer in digital banking, DBS Bank (Taiwan) strives to create a simple and seamless banking experience for customers through innovative digital solutions. DBS Bank (Taiwan) has launched SWIFT Global Payments Innovation (gpi) solution, making the bank the first bank in Taiwan to provide this enhanced capability to its clients. With real time tracking of cross border payments made available on its corporate online banking platform, DBS corporate clients are now able to access immediate, traceable and transparent information for their payments. Sylvia Tao, Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS Bank (Taiwan) said, “As companies gradually expand their global business landscape, the frequency and demand for cross-border payments has grown rapidly. Traditionally, when companies do cross-border payments, the biggest pain point is that the payment information is not real time or transparent.” “Traditionally, corporates have had to call the remitting bank to track, and wait for the bank to enquire from the intermediary banks if the clients want to confirm the status of cross-border payments. The process is not only lengthy but also complex. For clients, they need to allocate manpower resources to monitor these matters, which results in wasting time and reducing operational efficiency.” Sylvia said. Sylvia explained, “With SWIFT gpi, clients need only login to DBS IDEAL™, the corporate online banking platform, to instantly check the status of payments and to know whether the beneficiary has received the funds. Such innovative services not only enhance the transparency of cross-border payments but also helps enterprises to improve the efficiency of working capital management.” Atul Bhuchar, Group Payments Head, Global Transaction Services, DBS said: “Understanding our customers' job-to-be-done and their pain-points for cross-border payments enabled DBS to develop this truly digital solution, powered by SWIFT gpi. DBS customers in Taiwan can now leverage on this future-ready payments capability to strengthen relationships with their suppliers across the globe.” Michael Moon, Head of Payments Markets, Asia Pacific, SWIFT added, “We are delighted to have DBS, one of Asia’s largest and most innovative banks, extend their SWIFT gpi services in Taiwanese marketplace. The introduction of gpi tracking services to corporates in Taiwan will help to address core business frictions in the cross-border payment process and offer full visibility over what is happening with a payment after it is sent and when it has been received. This will in turn lead to more efficient payments to end customers and vendors, shorter supply cycles and a decrease in FX risks.” Worldwide there are around 150,000 payments a day worth USD 100 billion between banks that are live on gpi. The time taken for receipt of funds by the overseas beneficiary has come down from days to minutes or even seconds. DBS is the first bank in Asia to provide SWIFT gpi capability on corporate online banking platform - this was introduced first in Singapore and Hong Kong. Now, corporate and SME clients in DBS Bank (Taiwan) can also enjoy this innovative digital solution and leverage its convenience to bring more efficiency to their business operations.

DBS adds to line-up of stakeholder benefits in 50th year with SGD 500 presented to every employee,06 Jul 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_adds_to_line_up_of_stakeholder_benefits_in_50th_year_with_SGD_500_presented_to_every_employee, Singapore ,"- In conjunction with its 50th anniversary, DBS has thanked its shareholders and customers with a bumper dividend and special promotions, and ramped up support for communities across the region. Today, the bank expressed its gratitude to a group of people who have been integral to the bank’s journey and success – its employees. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta announced that the bank would gift SGD 500 to each of its 26,000 employees at a “Golden Jubilee” employee townhall held at the Victoria Theatre. A special guest at the townhall was former DBS Chairman S. Dhanabalan, who was among the founding group of employees instrumental in the establishment and running of DBS at its inception 50 years ago.  Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “In the last 50 years, DBS has evolved from Development Bank of Singapore to World’s Best Digital Bank. Recognising that this success would not have been possible without the support of our stakeholders, we felt it was important for our Jubilee celebrations to include a measure of giving back, whether to shareholders, customers or employees. For our people in particular, this special Jubilee gift comes ahead of DBS’ birthday on 16 July, and is an expression of our gratitude for their hard work, commitment and strong sense of purpose.” In May, DBS shareholders were rewarded when the bank paid out a special dividend of 50 cents per share as a one-time return of the capital buffers that had been built up and to mark DBS’ 50th anniversary of DBS. This was in addition to the payout of 60 cents per share for the final dividend of 2017, which brought the full-year ordinary dividend to 93 cents per share, an increase of 55% over the previous year. For customers, DBS has lined up a gamut of year-round “50-themed” promotions such as deals that provide 50% discounts, or SGD 50 cash gifts to thank customers for their support. In April, the bank launched the DBS “Win the Suite Life” promotion which will award an unprecedented 50 Singapore Airlines Suites class round-trip tickets to New York, London, Paris, Sydney or Shanghai to customers. Further details on these promotions are available at go.dbs.com/DBS50 . To give back to the community, the bank’s employees had actively mentored 50 social enterprises across its six key markets last year. DBS staff across the region will also be participating in 50 volunteer initiatives in the bank’s birthday month of July. Established in 1968 as the Development Bank of Singapore, DBS began with a purpose like none other – to help finance the industrialisation of Singapore. From the bank’s early days, its employees have been the industry’s trailblazers. For instance, in 1977, the bank launched the Pandan Valley condominium, Singapore’s largest condominium at the time. In 1980, DBS Autosave, the nation’s first interest-bearing current account in Singapore was introduced. In 1985, DBS propelled Singapore Airlines onto the global arena by being the lead manager for their IPO, the first international offering for a locally incorporated company. In 1986, DBS financed the development of Raffles City, paving the way for Singapore to be a leading convention and exhibition destination. DBS today continues its slew of firsts. In 2017, the bank launched POSB Smart Buddy – the world’s first in-school wearable tech savings and payments programme, and has the world’s largest banking API developer platform today. On the sustainability front, last year, DBS was the first financial institution in Singapore to issue a green bond. In addition, DBS played an active role in launching the Women's Livelihood Bond – the world's first social sustainability bond to be listed on a stock exchange. In 2014, DBS Foundation was set up with SGD 50 million dedicated to championing social enterprises (SEs) across the region. Each year, the foundation awards over SGD 1 million in grants to promising social enterprises. Image caption L-R: DBS Chairman Peter Seah; former DBS Chairman S.

"DBS introduces Jim, Southeast Asia’s first virtual bank recruiter",14 Jun 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_introduces_Jim_Southeast_Asias_first_virtual_bank_recruiter, Singapore ,"- DBS has launched Southeast Asia’s first virtual bank recruiter, Jim, to help its recruiters hire wealth planning managers more efficiently. The bank is looking to hire 40% more wealth planning managers this year to support its rapidly growing wealth management business. In pilot since April this year, Jim has helped DBS recruiters to review resumes, collect applicants’ responses for pre-screening questions, and conduct psychometric profiling assessments on candidates. Recruiters tend to spend up to 20% of their time collecting information and responding to emails before meeting with shortlisted candidates. By automating the pre-screening process, Jim will help save some 40 manhours a month. This enables recruiters to spend more time sourcing for candidates, interviewing applicants, focus on talent advisory or even upskilling themselves. With Jim, candidates also benefit from a faster, more streamlined process, with real-time interaction available 24/7.  “Our candidates are often busy during the day, and many of our recruiters end up working long hours to cater to their schedules. A virtual recruiter, such as Jim, would lighten our employees’ workload. Previously manual processes – such as posting screening questions, conducting psychometric assessments and tests – have now been fully automated. This frees up our recruiters’ time so they can take on higher value work,” said James Loo, Head of Talent Acquisition Group, Group Human Resources, DBS Bank. Jim, an acronym for “Jobs Intelligence Maestro”, is the brainchild of Singapore start-up Impress.AI and DBS’ Talent Acquisition team. It was custom-built to meet the needs of DBS’ recruiters and applicants. Jim is powered by artificial intelligence and over time, will learn to make better assessments in screening candidates. Over the course of a year, Impress.AI and DBS experimented with several different iterations to ensure a smooth application journey for candidates. So far, close to 100 applicants have provided feedback on their experience, with over 90% providing positive responses. One such applicant, Brandon Goon said, “DBS’ recruitment process demonstrates that they are serious about investing in technology to attract new talents, and they will have the tools and resources necessary to help me serve my clients better. This is very impressive, and it has made me more excited to join the bank.” Over the next few months, Jim will be available in DBS’ core markets – Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and India - for wealth planning manager roles. The virtual recruiter will also be made available for other high-volume roles such as the Management Associate and Graduate Associate programmes. These programmes typically see more than 7,000 candidates vying for 20 roles. [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS signals time has come for new kind of banking,15 May 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_signals_time_has_come_for_new_kind_of_banking," Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan ","- DBS Bank, a leader in digital transformation, today signalled that the time has come for a new kind of banking. After more than a decade of establishing its Asia heritage with “Living, Breathing Asia”, DBS is evolving its positioning to “Live more, Bank less”. Its bold new brand promise reflects the belief that in the digital era, it needs to deliver banking that is so simple, seamless and invisible, that customers have more time to spend on the people or things they care about. Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “In the last 10 years, we have successfully established ourselves as a leader in Asia banking. While we remain rooted to Asia, Asia is rapidly changing, like the rest of the world. With the ubiquity of the smartphone, the explosion of data and the rise of the sharing economy, customer behaviours are dramatically different from what they were before. Customers want a new kind of banking. Having made reimagining banking a priority in the last few years, we believe we are well-placed to personify and embody banking of the future.” From leadership in Singapore to leadership in Asia Over the last 50 years, DBS has established itself as a leader not just in Singapore but also in Asia.

"DBS launches Singapore's first holistic digital financial advisor ""Your Financial GPS""",08 May 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_Singapore_first_holistic_digital_financial_advisor_Your_Financial_GPS, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced the launch of “ Your Financial GPS ”, Singapore’s first holistic digital financial advisor that is now available to all DBS/POSB customers via DBS/POSB iBanking and digibank apps. With the launch, more than 2.5 million DBS/POSB customers can immediately access the digital advisor. It is an extension of the bank’s financial planning initiative “ NAV – Your Financial GPS ”, aimed at helping customers navigate through life’s changes, uncertainties and opportunities. Having a financial planner at your fingertips  Customisable expense categories in Your Financial GPS  Users can set and track budgets against specific expense categories  The digital financial advisor is integrated into customers’ banking transactional activities through DBS/POSB iBanking and digibank apps. This enables its budgeting functionality to provide analysis of customers’ bank account activity as income and expenses are automatically categorised. Customers are also provided with an overview of their set budgets, and can see how they are tracking against long-term financial-life goals with just a few clicks anytime, anywhere.  Your Financial GPS offers insights and advice on what users can do with extra cash savings  Your Financial GPS offers advice on how to get started on major life-financial goals The digital advisor then goes a step further by undertaking active analysis of customers’ current financial positions to offer tailored financial advice. It empowers them with actionable insights, so they can better manage their money and have a plan for savings and investments. For example, if a customer sets up a home goal, Your Financial GPS will first propose an ideal savings amount he or she can consider and at the same time, offer advice on the small steps that can be taken to make saving for the property easier. Your Financial GPS was developed based on feedback from more than 100 face-to-face customer interviews and 160 prototyping sessions. In addition, the bank also analysed huge volumes of user data and behavioural activity. Most customers found the consolidation of their expenses a tedious task, and preferred using apps which are customisable and go beyond just consolidating numbers. The majority of customers also indicated that they took a longer-term view to their financial-life goals, but did not know how much to peg to each goal, or if they were on track. In response, DBS debuted Your Financial GPS in a pilot launch in January this year to 300,000 customers aged 21 to 35. The pilot concluded with strong positive user feedback on its ease-of-use and usefulness of its insights. “Your Financial GPS is like having my personal financial planner in my pocket,” said Mr Daniel Lim, aged 26, one of the pilot users. “It tells me automatically where my money goes in a summary view, and that is incredibly useful because it is easy to forget the tiny sums here and there that do eventually add up. What’s even better is I now receive personal insights that guide me to manage my money better! I haven’t stopped recommending Your Financial GPS to my friends, as I believe financial planning is critical for the future and this gives us a head-start with a thorough understanding of one’s finances.” Set “SAIL” with DBS’ Your Financial GPS Your Financial GPS uses a “ SAIL ” concept – Saving, Assurance, Invest, Life Goals – to identify coordinates on a customer’s financial journey so that they can course correct with ease. Said Mr Brandon Lam, DBS’ Singapore Head of Financial Planning Group, “Financial planning can be confusing for some, as it covers a broad spectrum of interconnected topics. Helping our customers fulfil their financial-life goals and understand how to better manage their finances is of great importance to us as Singapore's largest bank. When we launched NAV Hub last year, we wanted to offer our customers a no-sales environment where they can embark on their financial planning journeys. The new Your Financial GPS advisor, which puts the bank’s financial planning expertise at one’s fingertips, mirrors the same ease and we hope it will help people make sensible decisions about their money clearly and easily, so that they can spend more time enjoying life and with the people who truly matter.” Come end May, DBS will also introduce “ YourNAV Community ” – a community forum that allows one to ask questions, find answers and share tips related to money management and financial planning topics. As a “ YourNAVer ”, one gets access to exclusives such as members-only events, classes, games and contests and can earn points when interacting with fellow community members.

"Yishun Riverwalk Residents' Committee (RC), POSB and Republic Polytechnic come together for the pilot launch of “POSB Smart Senior” programme",08 May 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Yishun_Riverwalk_Residents_Committee_RC_POSB_and_Republic_Polytechnic_come_together_for_the_pilot_launch_of_POSB_Smart_Senior_programme, Singapore ,"- Yishun Riverwalk RC, POSB and Republic Polytechnic today came together for the pilot launch of “ POSB Smart Senior ”, the world’s first holistic health and payment programme developed for seniors. The innovative programme features a new digital device, the “ POSB Smart Sleeve ”, which will enable various lifestyle conveniences with functions such as transit, payments, fitness and location-based tracking. Minister Ong Ye Kung, Minister of Education and Adviser to Gambas Grassroots Organisations , officiated at the launch event today which was held at Yishun Riverwalk. Developed for use together with a new contactless POSB ATM Card , the POSB Smart Sleeve allows users to make NETS contactless payments and conveniently doubles up as a NETS ABT (Account-Based Ticketing) card that can also be used to pay for public transport. It encourages seniors to maintain active, healthy lives by keeping track of their daily steps, and provides cashback incentives once the monthly goal of 100,000 steps is clocked. During the three-month pilot, seniors will get to enjoy 50% unlimited cashback off adult fares on all buses and MRT rides. They can also enjoy up to 50% cashback (up to SGD50 per month) when they pay via NETS Contactless and clock 100,000 steps in a month. Families with active seniors can have additional peace of mind as a SMS notification will be sent to a designated family member when seniors check in at the RC’s Smart Kiosk using their POSB Smart Sleeve. In addition, the water-resistant device can be personalised with the senior’s nickname and it also tells the date and time. 62 seniors in the pilot programme each received a customised set of the POSB Smart Sleeve and contactless POSB ATM Card. Several merchants around the district have also been equipped with contactless terminals with which the seniors can use their POSB Smart Sleeve to make purchases. POSB will draw on the feedback and insights provided by the participants at the end of the trial for future iterations of the initiative. The programme was developed based on feedback gathered from seniors through briefing sessions organised by grassroots volunteers and student volunteers from Republic Polytechnic early this year. Most of the seniors expressed an eagerness to adopt digital conveniences and contactless payment options, and many have already been engaging digitally with their family and friends. “I was very excited when I first heard of the POSB Smart Senior Programme, as I can do so many things with just one device! Now I can try using contactless payments when paying for my morning cup of coffee,” said Mdm Morie Lim Teck Cheo, aged 60, who is one of the participants in the pilot launch. “I like it that it also tracks my daily steps so I am reminded to keep active and healthy. With the SMS notification function, my child will be reassured whenever I go and meet my friends at the RC.”  Said Marianne Yam, Chairwoman of Yishun Riverwalk RC , “We have many seniors staying in our estate, and so it is important that we reach out to them with support on becoming digitally ready. The POSB Smart Senior pilot programme is a great induction for our seniors on becoming digitally savvy, and it is our hope that this will encourage them to learn to use other smart functions once they see and appreciate the various conveniences technology can afford them. The fact that our pilot programme is twice oversubscribed is a great start, and we look forward to partnering with POSB in the months ahead.” Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank , “The POSB Smart Senior pilot programme – a world’s first – carries on a long and proud POSB tradition of pioneering innovative financial solutions that cater to the evolving needs of Singaporeans. We took special care to design the programme’s mechanics and device functionalities so that our seniors can enjoy a seamless experience when using the POSB Smart Sleeve. We are heartened to hear them enthuse about how they can use the POSB Smart Sleeve together in their daily activities. I look forward to their feedback at the end of the pilot programme, which will help us to make future iterations even more useful with their desired functionalities.” In August 2017, the bank launched the “POSB Smart Buddy” programme, an initiative which uses wearable tech to teach students how to save and spend wisely by helping them track their savings and spending habits digitally. To date, more than 40 schools have already come onboard. [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS accelerates transition to renewable energy,26 Apr 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_accelerates_transition_to_renewable_energy, Singapore ,"- DBS, the first Asian bank and Singapore company to join global renewable energy initiative RE100, has affirmed its support for Singapore’s “Year of Climate Action” by announcing that 40% of the bank’s energy in Singapore will come from renewable energy sources by end-2018. Last year, the bank had committed to using 100% renewable energy for its Singapore operations by 2030. To meet this target, DBS is engaged in three major initiatives: operating its own solar energy installation, procuring renewable energy, and driving energy efficiencies across its organisation. Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli was guest of honour at today’s launch of the solar energy installation at DBS Asia Hub, the bank’s premises in Changi Business Park. Consisting of some 1,200 solar panels across 30,000 square feet – or around half the size of a football field, the installation is owned and maintained by DBS. The energy that is generated each year – over 460 MWh – will help offset DBS Asia Hub’s power consumption. DBS is also reviewing its real estate assets across the region to assess their suitability for future solar energy installations. To drive energy efficiencies, the bank has replaced lamps with energy-efficient LED lights across all its Singapore retail branches. DBS’ Singapore office buildings have also been certified by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) as environmentally friendly. [1] In addition, DBS has reduced the power consumed by its Singapore data centres by 50%, while increasing storage and computing capacity by seven times since 2014, by transforming its traditional data centres through technological advances. These initiatives have helped the bank reduce electricity consumption by some 9.6 GWh and achieve cost savings of SGD 3.8 million in 2017, compared to 2016. Supplementing these initiatives are DBS’ plans to become a major procurer of renewable energy [2] , which will help the bank transition to 40% renewable energy consumption. The latter is equivalent to some 14 GWh per year – enough to power more than 3,000 four-room HDB households for a year. [3] Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “Sustainability has been at the core of DBS’ purpose-driven DNA. From the time of our founding 50 years ago as the Development Bank of Singapore, we have always believed in the importance of good citizenship. Today, that extends to creating social impact by giving back to the community through the bank and DBS Foundation, and doing our part for the environment. We are supportive of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and have adopted as focus areas four of the SDGs, including climate action. As Singapore’s leading bank, we recognise our role in promoting sustainable development, including the transition to a low-carbon economy. We hope that our adoption of renewable energy to power our operations will play a part in catalysing the growth of the renewables sector and encourage more corporates to go green for a sustainable future.” Renewable energy has great growth potential in Singapore. A study by the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore has indicated that solar power can contribute up to a quarter of Singapore’s electricity by 2025. [4] Today, solar power makes up some 2% of Singapore’s energy generation [5] , in line with solar’s 1.3% global energy generation share. [6] Solar power is also taking off globally. According to the International Energy Agency, solar power was the fastest-growing source of new energy worldwide in 2016. New solar capacity grew by 50% in 2016, with China accounting for almost half of the global expansion. The agency predicts total solar capacity will exceed the combined total power capacities of India and Japan today by 2022. [7] DBS’ renewable energy initiatives are undertaken as part of the bank’s commitment to sustainable development. In addition to its RE100 membership, DBS was one of the first Singapore companies to launch a green bond in 2017. DBS was also the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index, a global sustainability index.  [1] DBS has been awarded the Green Mark certiﬁcation by BCA for all four of its ofﬁce buildings, with two of them achieving the highest Platinum award.

DBS launches real-time digital cross-border payment tracking for all corporate and SME clients,23 Apr 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_real_time_digital_cross_border_payment_tracking_for_all_corporate_and_SME_clients, Singapore ,"- More than 200,000 of DBS’ corporate and SME clients will now be able to benefit from better cashflow visibility through real-time cross-border payment tracking. DBS’ clients in Singapore and Hong Kong are the first in Asia to be able to tap into this digital solution at no extra cost. Powered by SWIFT Global Payments Innovation (gpi), DBS’ clients in China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan will also be able experience the same transaction transparency and speed in the next few months. Navinder Duggal, Group Head of Cash Product Management at DBS said that cross-border payments are becoming more commonplace as Asian businesses spread their wings and grow their supply chains globally. Duggal said, “When it comes to processing cross-border payments, corporate treasurers tell us that they want faster and more efficient payments. The DBS SWIFT gpi solution gives companies online visibility when tracking payments across more than 48 gpi banks across the globe and this is set to increase as more banks come on board.” “Corporate cross-border payment volumes have increased by 25% in the last 12 months. Today one in four of all cross-border transactions are received by their beneficiaries in less than two hours, and we expect these volumes to rise,” Duggal added. A SWIFT survey[1] found that 86% of treasurers are looking for efficient payment processes and effective customer support when choosing a bank for cross-border payments. While there has been much technological innovation, the survey also found that businesses wanted underlying challenges of payment tracking and speed with cross-border payments solved without the need to deploy expensive solutions and resources. With the new DBS SWIFT gpi solution, customers can now track[2] the status of their cross-border payments instantly, online without the need to call the DBS corporate call centre. By logging into DBS IDEAL, the Bank’s corporate online banking platform, clients will be able to find out whether funds have been received by the beneficiary, where the funds are in the cross-border payment chain. Today, one in four cross-border USD payments made by corporate and SME clients from Singapore and Hong Kong are benefitting from end-to-end visibility of their cross-border payments from origination to the receipt of funds by the beneficiary. Dai Kai, Chief Financial Officer, PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte. Ltd said that their business has benefitted from having a real-time cashflow position. “This is an example of an innovative initiative that gives corporates like us complete transparency of cross-border payments settlement online and helps make doing business easier,” said Dai. Hong Kong’s TCC Group[3] Tony Lam, General Manager, Finance and Treasury Division said that the group is using the solution to help them stay on top of their cash management needs. “Efficient cash management has become much more important than in the past to shipping groups like TCC. By pioneering this new online initiative, DBS has enabled us to keep constantly ahead in the global marketplace,” said Lam. Associate Professor Ng Wai Hoe, Medical Director, National Neuroscience Institute said that NNI appreciated the flexibility of online tracking without the need to call DBS’ corporate hotline. “NNI is benefitting from operational efficiency and productivity. We are now also able to have greater visibility on each transaction, and this benefits our vendors as well,” said Ng. DBS business clients making cross-border payments to other DBS accounts across its network benefit from instant transfers in six markets, leveraging DBS’ Asian connectivity. Called DBS PriorityPay, the value of transactions through this service has increased year-on-year by 60%.

Aksesori ini diberikan ke seluruh staf Bank DBS. Koleksi aksesori berlapis emas 18 karat ini terdiri atas manset untuk pria, dan kalung untuk wanita. Seluruh staf Bank DBS di 18 pasar menerima hadiah spesial ini dan dengan bangga telah mengenakan DBS Sparks – secara harfiah di dekat jantung dan lengan baju mereka.

Semua ini bisa terlaksana berkat semangat dan keyakinan seluruh staf kami."" Berdiri sejak tahun 1968 sebagai Development Bank of Singapore, Bank DBS memulai langkahnya dengan tujuan yang berbeda dari bank lainnya – membantu pembiayaan industri di Singapura. Di awal kemunculannya, para karyawan DBS telah menjadi pelopor industri.

Di tahun 1980, diperkenalkan DBS Autosave – rekening giro berbunga pertama di Singapura. Tahun 1985, Bank DBS mendorong Singapore Airlines ke arena global dengan menjadi manajer utama untuk IPO mereka – perusahaan lokal Singapura pertama yang ditawarkan secara internasional.

Hingga kini, Bank DBS selalu menjadi yang terdepan. Di tahun 2017, Bank DBS meluncurkan POSB Smart Buddy – program teknologi pembayaran dan tabungan pertama di dunia yang dapat dilakukan di sekolah, dan saat ini memiliki platform API developer perbankan terbesar di dunia. Paulus Sutisna, President Director PT Bank DBS Indonesia mengatakan, “Untuk merayakan tahun emas Grup Bank DBS, hadiah DBS Sparks merupakan sebuah bentuk penghargaan bagi dedikasi, kerja keras dan komitmen karyawan kami.

Kemarin, Bank DBS juga telah mengusulkan dibuatkan dividen khusus sebesar 50 sen per saham untuk menandai ulang tahun ke-50 Bank DBS. Bank DBS juga mengabadikan semangat Bank DBS melalui mini  series Sparks yang telah mendapatkan berbagai penghargaan, yang menceritakan dinamika sekelompok bankir Bank DBS saat mereka menghadapi tantangan dan meraih kesempatan dalam dunia kerja dan kehidupan pribadi mereka.

DBS targets 30% reduction in corporate cheque payments by 2020,05 Apr 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_targets_30pct_reduction_in_corporate_cheque_payments_by_2020, Singapore ,"- To help corporate clients keep in step with changing consumer behaviour where digital payments are becoming more popular [1] , DBS bank today announced that it would help its corporate clients reduce cheque usage by at least 30% in the next 24 months. The Bank projects that this will lead to a reduction of millions of cheques issued by companies. DBS corporate clients can now plug into the bank’s Application Programming Interface (APIs) to pay their retail customers instantly through PayNow [2] . The new digital payment solution is powered by DBS IDEAL RAPID [3] which helps corporate clients expedite their customers’ payments so that they can receive their claims instantly. As a leader in digital banking, DBS Bank is working with government agencies and all companies to help them shift from traditional payment methods to digital alternatives such as PayNow and FAST [4] . Raof Latiff, Head of Digital, Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank, said the bank has seen a five-fold increase in corporate clients requesting for digital payment solutions to be embedded into their payments processes over the last 12 months. “Consumer behaviour is changing so quickly and businesses find themselves having to stay abreast with changing payment demands. The man-on-the-street wants to receive their payments instantly, without the need to bank in a cheque. The ubiquity of the mobile phone means that cheque payments will soon be a thing of the past and forward-looking companies are re-working their business processes to stay relevant, save time and serve their customers better.” The insurance industry is an early adopter of PayNow. DBS is working with insurance companies to introduce instant claims payments through PayNow where only a mobile number or NRIC number is needed for approved claims to be disbursed. Currently, most insurance claims are paid through cheques which account for about 10% of corporate cheques issued by DBS in Singapore. Through such companies making such changes to their payments processes, the bank foresees a 30% reduction in corporate cheque usage by 2020. Mr Ho Kai Weng, Chief Executive, General Insurance Association of Singapore said, “Speed and convenience are key for claimants when it comes to their insurance claims. We are making a difference in both these areas with PayNow. They will receive their payments instantaneously, and do not need to visit a bank to deposit their cheques. For our member insurers, this new way of making payments also means better operational efficiency.” Since 2017, DBS has introduced a slew of innovative solutions as well as differentiated pricing structures to speed up electronic payments and funds transfer adoption among its corporate clients. They range from a complete waiver of monthly charges for usage of its corporate banking platform IDEAL, to dramatically reducing FAST pricing from SGD 5 to a low SGD 0.50. DBS also launched corporate bill payments via IDEAL earlier this year, enabling all its corporate clients to pay bills online. With these offerings, DBS has seen payments via FAST grow by more than 300% and digital payments increase by 25% amongst corporate clients. DBS was also the first among its peers in Singapore to launch its revolutionary API platform, IDEAL RAPID, creating instant payments and streamlined processes for corporate customers.

DBS and Joseph Schooling team up to inspire youths and the young-at-heart to achieve their dreams,02 Apr 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Joseph_Schooling_team_up_to_inspire_youths_and_the__young_at_heart_to_achieve_their_dreams, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced that it will partner Joseph Schooling, Singapore’s Olympic Games, World Championships and Asian Games medallist to inspire next-generation Singaporeans and the young at heart to think big and dig deep to work towards achieving their dreams.  The three-year partnership from 2018 to 2020 will see Schooling and DBS get their feet wet by reaching out to next-generation Singaporeans through a series of community activities and social media engagements to encourage and influence them to overcome their challenges and forge their own paths to success.  Just like DBS, Joseph Schooling is guided by a strong sense of purpose, passion and a spirit of excellence.  Sim S. Lim, DBS’ Singapore Country Head said, “Joseph Schooling’s journey as a young boy with a dream in his heart to do Singapore proud as a swimming champion is one of unwavering purpose and dedication. As DBS traces our roots back to 1968, it was our commitment to financing the industrialisation of a newly-independent nation that has brought us to where we are. Today, we are recognised as one of the safest and best banks globally. As we turn 50, we are excited about the future and we believe that like Joseph, all of us have that spark in us which can be ignited as we press in and work towards achieving our dreams.”  Joseph Schooling said, “I work hard every day to make Singapore proud and think about what it means to be Singaporean. To me, DBS is what a Singaporean brand should be and it is an honour to work with them. They serve their customers well, they’re true to their roots, they’re ambitious and work hard every day to make Singapore proud. That’s why I took the plunge with DBS and made them my partner of choice.”  As a purpose-driven organisation, DBS believes it can make an impact in society through the investment of time and its efforts in the communities it is present in. It is this strong sense of purpose and commitment to excellence that has spurred DBS to greater heights.  Schooling added, “Since winning Singapore’s first Olympic gold medal in 2016, I’ve been overwhelmed by the love and the support that everyone has shown me. In the last two years, I’ve achieved more success but also tasted defeat. From the highs of victory to the lows of defeat, I dig deep to train even harder as I set my sights on 2020[1]. Together with DBS, I want to inspire the next generation of Singaporeans through my journey to not just work hard but live life to the fullest.”  Preparing for life after swimming – diving into a wealth of opportunities  When Schooling hangs up his swim cap as a professional swimmer, he will also be a graduate with a business degree from the University of Texas. Armed with a major in economics, Schooling also harbours ambitions to work in the wealth management industry.  To help kick-start his journey in wealth management, DBS will explore opportunities to work with Schooling to arrange for internships and mentoring sessions when they can coincide with his professional swim training schedule.  The bank is familiar with what it takes to support professional athletes transition into their corporate career and has experienced mentors to come alongside employees trying to balance sports and work excellence[2]. Since 2014, DBS has collaborated with Sports Singapore and is a partner of the spexBusiness programme[3].  Most recently, DBS partnered Nanyang Technological University to launch a new Applied Wealth Management track for undergraduates who are interested in pursuing a career in wealth management. The banks also runs Southeast Asia’s largest hackathon recruitment programme - DBS Hack2Hire. It is the first such recruitment drive in Southeast Asia which uses a hackathon to identify and hire the best emerging technology talent in Singapore.  Lim added, “We take pride in having a diversity of talent from different backgrounds and disciplines. Their varied experiences, knowledge and expertise are what drives our high performance and ability to make banking simpler, faster and better for our customers who interact very differently with their bank these days.” DBS was recognised by Aon Hewitt as the ‘Best Employer in Asia Pacific’ for the second year running in 2017.

"DBS Indonesia Luncurkan DBS Treasury Prism, Platform Simulasi Digital terbaru untuk Keuangan dan Cash Management",29 Mar 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Indonesia_Luncurkan_DBS_Treasury_Prism_Platform_Simulasi_Digital_terbaru_untuk_Keuangan_dan_Cash_Management, Indonesia ,"- PT Bank DBS Indonesia (Bank DBS Indonesia) sebuah bank terkemuka di Asia, hari ini secara resmi meresmikan DBS Treasury Prism (treasuryprism.dbs.com) di Indonesia. Platfrom revolusioner ini – sudah tersedia secara global sejak tahun lalu – adalah alat simulasi perbendaharaan dan cash management online pertama di dunia yang diperuntukkan bagi CFO dan bendahara perusahaan. Platform ini memampukan pengguna untuk mensimulasikan berbagai solusi bank dan korporasi tanpa biaya, serta kemampuan untuk meninjau peluang potensi maksimal nilai bagi perusahaan. Tren yang senantiasa berubah membuat tuntutan kebutuhan bendahara korporasi dan manajer keuangan kini tidak lagi dapat dipenuhi oleh produk perbankan standar. Perpaduan proposisi bisnis digital antara perusahaan, penyedia layanan keuangan, dan klien mereka – sebagai unsur terpenting – telah menjadi fundamental. Dengan berfokus pada transformasi digital, DBS mengadopsi pendekatan ko-kreasi untuk desain produk dan inovasi. Treasury Prism merupakan bentuk komitmen DBS yang berfokus pada pelanggan dan juga perwujudan layanan dalam hal inovasi dan pengembangan produk. Iwan RUSLI – Head of Global Transaction Services PT DBS Bank Indonesia mengatakan, “Di DBS, kami secara proakif melihat bagaimana layanan konsultasi digital berkembang bagi pelanggan kami. Platform Treasury Prism DBS memberi lebih banyak kendali kepada pelanggan untuk mengelola likuiditas mereka, perputaran masuk dan asal dana, bagaimana dan kapan, dan itu semua dapat diakses dari manapun di dunia ini. Solusi ini sangat tepat waktu dan bermanfaat bagi pasar Indonesia dengan cepatnya perkembangan internet dan komunitas jaringan, dikombinasikan dengan tantangan rumit yang dihadapi perusahaan. DBS telah mewawancarai lebih dari 50 CFO, bendahara perusahaan dan profesional keuangan dalam mengembangkan Treasury Prism, dan menemukan lima area kritis yang dihadapi oleh industri perbendaharaan: Terlalu banyak proses persiapan untuk mencapai solusi yang optimal Kesulitan dalam memonetisasi atau memperhitungkan solusi yang terukur dari keuntungan dan biaya yang diajukan oleh bank yang berbeda Terbatasnya waktu untuk selalu mengikuti informasi dan peraturan baru, perubahan pajak dan kondisi pasar. Terlalu banyak usaha diperlukan untuk bekerja dengan para pemegang saham dalam solusi pengelolaan keuangan terbaru. Kesulitan dalam penerapan solusi yang baru dan kompleks DBS Treasury Prism dirancang untuk menyediakan perspektif baru dalam mengoptimalkan cash management . Ini adalah sebuah platform yang dapat dikostumisasi untuk mengatasi masalah-masalah tersebut, yaitu dengan cara memberikan CFO dan bendahara perusahaan kemampuan untuk melakukan percobaan secara independen terhadap struktur uang dan pengelolaan likuiditas, serta menganalisa kemungkinan keuntungan dan biaya. Terlepas dari bank mana mereka melakukan kerjasama, perusahaan dapat menggunakan DBS Treasury Prism untuk meninjau peraturan dan perpajakan dimana mereka beroperasi. Melalui platform ini pun mereka bisa menerima insight yang cepat dan kontekstual untuk membantu mereka memahami implikasi bisnis dari masing-masing solusi yang ada.

DBS aims to hire another 100 of the best emerging technology talents,27 Mar 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_aims_to_hire_another_100_of_the_best_emerging_technology_talents, Singapore ,"- In an all-out effort to identify and hire the best emerging technology talent in Singapore, DBS announced today that it plans to hire up to 100 of the brightest tech sparks through its Hack2Hire programme. This will double the number of technology talent that the bank has hired through the same programme in 2017.  The DBS Hack2Hire programme consists of two parts. The first part is an online technical assessment designed by DBS’s technology team to gauge the base skillsets required for the jobs. Those who pass the online technical assessment will then hack their way into solving real-life business use cases in a team setting using their technical, analytical and problem-solving skills in under 24 hours. Successful candidates will be offered a job within the same day. Given the success of DBS’ Hack2Hire recruits from 2017, DBS is expanding the programme’s remit to hire for a wider range of technology skillsets. Last year, the bank recruited developers, data scientists and system engineers through the Hack2Hire programme. This year, it is not only hiring for these roles, but also looking to add scrum masters [1] , user interface and user experience designers, mobile application developers, and solution architects, to create an all-rounded, Agile technology team [2] . Soh Siew Choo, DBS’ Group Head of Consumer Banking and Big Data Analytics Technology, said that DBS is transforming digitally to keep pace with the fast-changing behavioural and consumption patterns of its customers. “To reimagine banking, it is important that we leverage the latest technology and embed ourselves in the customer journey. The new tech talents bring fresh perspectives and skillsets, and complement existing teams to enable us to continue making banking simpler and more effortless for customers.” The DBS Hack2Hire programme is the first such recruitment drive in Southeast Asia. Foo Cher Fong, a Data Scientist who joined DBS through Hack2Hire last year, said, “When I first joined DBS, it was completely different from what I imagined it to be. The culture is like a start-up and it is very dynamic. As an employee, I am constantly encouraged to give my best, learn more and improve further. In my previous company, I was dealing with data of a different variety, image processing and visual effects. The bank provided the relevant training to help me transition into my new role and learn how to master modern stack technologies.” Over the last five years, DBS has made significant investments in strategic technology initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time on people or things that they care about. This includes initiating a comprehensive re-architecture of the bank’s technology backbone as well as catalysing a change in culture within the bank to one that is more “startup-like” in nature. DBS’ digital-first strategy has enabled it to broaden its footprint in growth markets like India and Indonesia without expensive physical distribution networks. DBS has been recognised widely for its digital leadership, including being named “World’s Best Digital Bank” by prestigious financial magazine Euromoney in 2016.

DBS India amongst LinkedIn Top 25 Companies - Where India Wants to Work in 2018,21 Mar 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_India_amongst_LinkedIn_Top_25_Companies_Where_India_Wants_to_Work_in_2018, India ,"- DBS Bank India today announced that it has been recognised as one of the top 25 companies where India Wants to Work in 2018 by LinkedIn. DBS has made a debut this year at rank 15. The Top Companies list is based on the actions taken by LinkedIn members and looks at four main pillars: interest in the company, engagement with the company’s employees, job demand and employee retention. Commenting on the occasion, Kishore Poduri, Head, Human Resources, DBS Bank India, said, “Over the years, DBS has invested in transforming itself digitally. The bank has challenged the way banking has operated traditionally to do things differently. A key part of this mission was to embed ourselves in our customers’ life to re-imagine their journeys to make banking invisible. Central to core of this transformation was to create a start-up culture and mindset where every employee is encouraged to embrace experimentation, entrepreneurship and innovation. This recognition makes us confident that we are on the right track to embrace workforce transformation thus raising the bar of workforce engagement in the country.” DBS is one of the first banks in the region to adopt human-centred design thinking. Employees are exposed to agile methodology and other digital concepts through customer journey workshops and hackathons. To keep its people engaged and motivated, in addition to monetary compensation DBS offers non-monetary rewards and a range of leave benefits. DBS recognises that people have different needs at different life stages, and has created, an initiative that gives employees the flexibility to choose the benefits that best suit their health, lifestyle and family needs. Further, DBS India’s offices have been designed to help foster innovation and cross team collaboration. This is done through an open office concept and dedicated spaces such as social hubs for networking as well as innovation and journey laboratories. DBS was the first Singapore bank to set up a representative office in India in 1994, upgrading it to a formal bank branch a year later. DBS was the first amongst the large foreign banks to apply and receive in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank of India to form a wholly-owned subsidiary in India.

Once the switch is done, customers can look forward to their selected electricity plans provided by their new electricity retailer, without any service disruption. Said Jeremy Soo, DBS Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) , “DBS Electricity Marketplace exemplifies how we are reimagining banking, using digital technology and innovation to make life simpler for our customers. Through our partnerships with alternative electricity retailers, we want to enable our customers to enjoy savings on their bills easily. Our insights also indicate that consumers want a fuss-free process to sign up for other electricity retailers, and we have made it easier and convenient for them to make the switch with just a few simple clicks on DBS/POSB digibank.” Since 2001, the Energy Market Authority has been liberalising the electricity market in Singapore in phases and the pilot phase for residents in Jurong will start from April 2018.

"At 50, DBS unveils new look",02 Mar 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/At_50_DBS_unveils_new_look, Singapore ,"- In commemoration of its 50 th anniversary, DBS has unveiled the fifth major iteration of its uniform. Come 5 March , customers will see the bank’s branch employees wearing the new uniforms across Singapore. The collection, by Singaporean designer Phuay Li Ying of ‘Ying the Label’ , features distinctive print patterns taken from an abstract watercolour art piece with red and black brushstrokes. Said Karen Ngui, DBS Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications , “As we celebrate our golden jubilee, we wanted to make sure our people’s uniforms would reflect DBS’ spirit of creativity and dynamism. The designs had to be distinctive and enduring, yet simple and versatile, reflecting our relationships and interactions with our customers. We believe good art and design will stand the test of time – much as DBS has since it was founded to help industrialise a young Singapore 50 years ago, and will continue to as we innovate for the future.” The uniforms will be rolled out across the region – with some 1,200 employees to don the new designs. Made with high quality and comfortable fabrics to ensure ease of movement, women have a range of options such as a blouse, skirt, pants, dress and jacket, and includes designs for Muslim employees as well as maternity wear. Menswear uniforms include subtle design details such as panel piping and the DBS Spark cufflinks. Said Ms. Harnieta Aris, aged 38, an officer at DBS Raffles Place Branch who has worked with the bank for 12 years, “The new uniform is simple yet sophisticated, and I like that the print is unique to us. The lines are clean and simple, just as we seek to make banking simple and easy for customers.” Said designer Ms. Phuay Li Ying , “The core inspiration while designing was to modernise the uniforms, and to reflect the true spirit of DBS’ people. I wanted to reflect a fun element in the uniforms, creativity with the combination of prints, as well as contemporary styles to reflect the adaptability of the bank in this new digital age.

Three in four SMEs in Singapore unfazed by proposed GST hikes,01 Mar 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Three_in_four_SMEs_in_Singapore_unfazed_by_proposed_GST_hikes, Singapore ,"- Amid the flurry of GST-themed debates in Parliament this week, a poll [1] of 240 Singapore SMEs banked by DBS revealed that they are unfazed by the impending GST hike. Three in four SMEs believe that the impending GST hikes would only have moderate to no impact on their businesses.  SMEs polled were confident of weathering the hike because they were of the opinion that new grants such as the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) and Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) would be able to provide some relief. More than half the SMEs polled said that they were looking to the grants to help address some of their business challenges such as reducing manpower costs, enhancing productivity, and increasing sales and revenue. The extension of the wage credit scheme was well received, with 82% of SME owners responding favourably to it. This was especially important when labour costs continued to plague six in 10 of the SMEs who had taken the poll.  Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said, “SMEs are resilient, and many are known to weather storms and the ups and downs of every economic cycle. The early proposal of the GST hike means that SME owners have enough lead time to plan ahead and ensure that they have the necessary provisions when the tax is implemented. SMEs are the backbone of the Singapore economy, and they need an ecosystem of banks, business partners and different government support plans as they look to grow and flourish not just in Singapore but also beyond our shores.” Most Singapore SMEs may not have the confidence to regionalise their businesses One in three SMEs surveyed said that the lack of knowledge of new markets were hindering their overseas growth, and 30% of them cited the lack of capital as one of the biggest challenges when executing their regionalisation plans. However, eight in 10 said that they would be more confident about accessing regional market opportunities, given the right resources such as access to capital and market insights. “SMEs owners continue to aspire to grow their business regionally and it weighs heavily on their minds. While they are confident of their ability to thrive in their home market of Singapore, some may lack the confidence to compete in new markets,” said Tee. Kausshal Dugarr, Founder and CEO of Teabox is one such SME owner who has taken the leap. Teabox now operates in Singapore and India, and supplies teas to over 110 countries worldwide. “When it comes to growing revenues and one’s customer base, expanding a business overseas is a natural next step. While there have been ups and downs, I’m thankful to have DBS as a business partner. Over the years, the DBS team has given me extensive support, from funding to advisory services, their expertise has helped me scale my business and hit key business milestones,” Dugarr said. When it comes to regionalisation, 67% of SMEs polled felt that the double tax deduction for internationalisation was important when factoring in the opportunity cost of expansion. “Expanding into new markets is a priority for us. However, breaking into overseas markets can be costly and the double tax deduction scheme will help me to save costs which I can then use to reinvest in my business,” Dugarr said. DBS has supported the growth and development of regional SMEs with a suite of digital products and services including DBS BusinessClass, a global social network for start-up and SME owners seeking business advice and cross-border opportunities; DBS Corporate Multi-Currency Account, where customers can manage up to 13 currencies in a single account; and the DBS-Xero partnership, where SME customers can enjoy simplified bill payments, even with invoices and payments issued from markets across the region.

The poll aimed to get their views on the Budget’s proposed measures announced on 19 February.

"Migrant workers centre, POSB and merchant partners come together in first-of-its-kind membership programme to benefit under-served migrant worker community",22 Feb 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/MIGRANT_WORKERS_CENTRE_POSB_AND_MERCHANT_PARTNERS_COME_TOGETHER_IN_FIRST_OF_ITS_KIND_MEMBERSHIP_PROGRAMME_TO_BENEFIT_UNDER_SERVED_MIGRANT_WORKER_COMMUNITY, Singapore ,"- The Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC), working with key programme partner POSB and various merchant partners, has developed a new membership programme catered specifically to migrant workers in Singapore. The MWC-POSB Membership programme brings together various merchant partners to offer exclusive benefits and savings to migrant workers. This was announced by NTUC Secretary-General Chan Chun Sing at a partners’ breakfast this morning.  The MWC-POSB Membership programme is the first of its kind to bring together different lifestyle and commercial merchants to offer meaningful benefits targeted specifically at migrant workers in Singapore, and at no cost to them. Members can look forward to savings on services that they use on a daily basis, such as remittance, mobile talk time and travel. Up to 200,000 migrant workers could potentially benefit in the first year of the programme. The membership programme will ride on the existing Work Pass Application system that allows employers the option of opening POSB bank accounts for their migrant workers. POSB is the only local bank that performs this service within the Work Pass Application system. The strategic partnership with POSB aims to strengthen MWC’s push for mandatory electronic payment of salary for migrant workers. Membership Benefits Under the MWC-POSB Membership programme, migrant workers will have access to the following benefits: i) All-in-One Banking Members will receive a POSB ATM card that doubles-up as a NETS 2.0 transit-enabled card. They can use the online banking services available via the POSB jolly App, which includes a newly-enhanced remittance capability that allows migrant workers to easily remit money back to their home countries in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines. ii) Remittance Services The MWC has also brought together remittance players to migrant workers to offer benefits and enhance the membership’s overall remittance proposition. Through these partnerships, members will be availed a wide array of affordable and attractive remittance options to cater to any of their preferences when sending money home to their loved ones. iii) Insurance Coverage A new, affordable Migrant Worker Group Insurance will be made available under NTUC Income, to protect migrant workers against serious injury or death not arising from work. iv) Telco Services Members will be able to enjoy attractive StarHub Mobile prepaid offers and stay connected with family, friends and co-workers easily and affordably. These offers include top-up, data and talk time bonuses as well as exclusive product and service bundles made available only to members. v) Travel Perks for Home Leave Members will be able to enjoy discounts on airfares and seasonal package offers from participating travel agencies as an added benefit when planning their home leave. vi) Mobility A tie-up with oBike will make it easier for members to process their oBike bicycle-sharing accounts online and enjoy seasonal offers and discounts. Phased Approach to Get Migrant Workers on Board The MWC-POSB Membership will be offered in two phases, targeting newly arrived migrant workers first. In this phase, new migrant workers who have their work permit applications submitted on or after 1 April 2018, and whose employers have opened a POSB bank account for them, will be issued an all-in-one MWC-POSB ATM and Membership card upon bank account activation. The second phase will see the MWC targeting existing work permit holders with POSB bank accounts. Workers can sign up for the MWC-POSB Membership once the self-service membership sign-up module in the POSB jolly App is completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. A digital card, which will also be recognised by participating merchants for the purpose of redeeming membership benefits, will be issued to them (via the POSB jolly App) in place of the physical ATM card. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Chairman of the MWC, said, “The MWC-POSB Membership programme is part of our ongoing efforts to improve the work and living conditions of our migrant workers in Singapore. We are very encouraged by the response we have received from our partners who share our commitment to the cause, as this reflects a growing sentiment of more in our society wanting to treat our migrant workers well. We are very happy to be working together with our key programme partner, POSB, on such a meaningful initiative and together, we will continue to improve the programme to give better package value to our migrant workers.” Said Mr Sim S Lim, DBS Singapore Country Head, “As the People’s Bank, POSB is committed to providing banking services to all communities in Singapore. We understand some of the challenges that migrant workers face when settling into a new country and we want to support them by providing them with access to essential banking and remittance services. Through the POSB jolly App, workers can monitor remotely when their salaries are being credited and they also have various options to make money remittances back to their home countries without incurring any additional fees. We are delighted to partner MWC in our drive to serve the migrant worker community – the unsung heroes who have also contributed to nation building.” POSB jolly Provides Migrant Workers with Peace of Mind POSB and MWC are seeking to empower migrant workers with access to basic electronic banking services. By availing mobile banking services to them, the workers will be able to safekeep their own money whilst having easy access to it. This will enable workers to, at any time, remotely enquire if their salaries have been credited, giving them greater peace of mind. The POSB jolly App also provides migrant workers with other banking services such as checking of transactions, topping up of prepaid SIM as well as remitting of money to their families in their home countries safely in a fast and simple manner. Following feedback from migrant workers, POSB collaborated with money transfer company MoneyGram to offer more remittance options to countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Other than remitting to an overseas bank account in these countries, workers can also use the app to send money to predefined beneficiaries, who can then collect cash from their home countries’ MoneyGram cash collection points. Yogesh Sangle, MoneyGram’s head of APAC, Middle East and South Asia, said, “We are delighted to partner with DBS/POSB to drive financial inclusion in the region. The new digital channel enables us to reach a greater customer base with a simple solution that can be operated on a basic feature phone. I hope that our customers will appreciate the convenience of this self-service remittance channel.” POSB jolly also provides information on the Ministry of Manpower’s policies as well as useful links to Singapore Police Force, MWC and the MWC’s sister NGO, the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE). To cater to migrant workers from different countries, POSB jolly is available in five languages – Tamil, Bengali, Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese and English. The POSB jolly App was piloted in 2016 and there are now over 100,000 users.

DBS and NTU team up to train Singapore’s next generation of wealth management talent,13 Feb 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_NTU_team_up_to_train_Singapores_next_generation_of_wealth_management_talent, Singapore ,"- To groom job-ready wealth management talent and cater to growing industry demand for such expertise in Singapore, DBS Bank and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) today announced a partnership to build a sustainable talent pool of wealth management associates.  DBS and NTU will launch a new Applied Wealth Management track for undergraduates, and it will be introduced under the current Banking and Finance specialisation of the Bachelor of Business degree programme by NTU’s Nanyang Business School. The new track, the first of its kind at undergraduate level in Singapore, aims to equip graduates with applied and academic competencies, including regulatory certifications and digital skill sets to become job-ready wealth management professionals ready to serve the emerging affluent. Developed in collaboration with NTU’s Wealth Management Institute (WMI), the Applied Wealth Management track aims to accept up to 50 students for each academic year starting from this August, with the first cohort comprising those who enrolled at NTU in August 2017. Singapore is one of the world’s leading financial hubs, and the demand for skilled wealth managers is increasing as Asia Pacific is home to the largest number of wealthy individuals [1] , and continues to have the largest and fastest growing mass affluent segment in the world [2] . Tan Su Shan, Managing Director and Group Head of Consumer Banking and Wealth Management, DBS Bank said, “To meet the demands of the next generation of emerging affluent customers, we need to build a workforce of job-ready wealth managers today. From ensuring that these students have the best-in-class curriculum to hands-on training, through this course, we want to develop innovative and committed bankers who are ready to succeed in the future economy.” Wealth management is a strategic priority for DBS, and the business has grown from strength to strength. Today, the business accounts for around 17 per cent of the bank’s income. Professor Ling San, NTU Provost and Vice-President (Academic), said, “The new Applied Wealth Management track builds on NTU’s pedagogy of equipping our students with industry experience as part of their academic programme, and gives our students a head start in pursuing attractive careers in wealth management. “By incorporating WMI’s practice-based wealth management curriculum in the degree programme, including mandatory industry certification, coupled with the comprehensive structured internships, our students will learn about wealth management in the ‘real world’ context, gain first-hand experience with clients, and understand what it takes to be successful in the wealth management business.” Job-ready Wealth Management Associates Students under the new Applied Wealth Management track will undergo two internships with DBS Bank – a 10-week and 20-week stint at the end of their second and third years of study respectively. The internships are designed to provide a solid understanding of wealth management, first-hand client interactions and an immersion into the digital banking environment at DBS. They will graduate with the required regulatory certifications, including WMI’s Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) Level 1 priority banking curriculum, and Capital Markets and Financial Advisory Services (CMFAS) papers. This will enable graduates to start work immediately, instead of the current practice of being required to first undergo a six-month training and certification period. This will mentally prepare them for the demands of the job, and they can also leverage an extensive network made up of DBS senior management. In addition, students who show an aptitude in banking will be offered a full-time job at DBS even before they graduate from NTU. These high performers will start their career as wealth management associates in the bank’s consumer banking group, and after a year, selected associates will be offered a place in DBS Treasures, the bank’s wealth management segment. Ms Foo Mee Har, Chief Executive Officer of NTU’s WMI, said, “Fresh graduates joining the wealth management industry typically undergo a lengthy period of training and certification of about six months before they are deemed ready to serve clients. Furthermore, they are often overwhelmed by the additional learning required to be ‘licensed’ for practice in the industry, involving specialised skills and competencies. ""This new formula will help undergraduates to be fully job-ready on day one of their new jobs, and accelerate development of a strong pipeline of talent for the fast-growing wealth management industry.” Students say new track will give them an edge Applications for the new Applied Wealth Management track will begin at the end of the current academic year, but interest in it is already rising. Randall Pay, 23, a first-year business student at NTU, said, “Clinching a job in wealth management before graduation is a tall order, so I’m excited to find out about the Applied Wealth Management track. Starting a banking career comes with many challenges, and being part of a programme that will prepare me for the corporate world will give me an edge over my peers.” Ryan Lee, 22, also a first-year business student at NTU, also said, “In this volatile job market, I want to be job ready even before graduation. The new Applied Wealth Management track allows me to have a better understanding of the job, thereby raising the level of my professionalism. It will also equip me with the required industry certifications so that I can hit the ground running and have a head start when I start work.” NTU’s Nanyang Business School is regarded amongst the best globally, and is one of the most established and comprehensive providers of business and management education in the Asia-Pacific. The school’s MBA programme was ranked 22nd globally – a jump from 24th – in the latest Financial Times MBA rankings announced last month. DBS was recently conferred the prestigious ‘Best of the Best’ award at the 2017 Aon Hewitt Best Employer Awards, and was also named “Best Wealth Manager, Singapore” by The Asset.

DBS SME Banking establishes retail F&B coverage team to cater to more companies expanding overseas,11 Feb 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_SME_Banking_establishes_retail_FandB_coverage_team_to_cater_to_more_companies_expanding_overseas, Singapore ,"- To cater to the financial needs of Singapore-based retail food and beverage (F&B) and food manufacturing companies expanding overseas, DBS today announced that it has established a dedicated F&B coverage team to better serve these customers.   F&B customers will be able to tap into the bank’s expertise in financial structures, cash management and foreign exchange solutions to help better manage their cashflow. In addition, customers can benefit from DBS’ Asian network, and its domain knowledge in areas such as rental, manpower and taxation in the markets they seek to expand into.  The SME Banking coverage team comprises 15 relationship managers and credit specialists who have close to 200 years of banking experience between them. The team is supported by two senior sector specialists from the bank’s Group Research team.  While banking the F&B sector is not new to DBS, in the last 18 months, the bank saw four in ten of its F&B SME customers expand overseas, with top expansion markets being tier-two cities in markets like China, Indonesia and Taiwan. This is a two-fold increase over the last five years. The overseas expansion is driven by limited growth opportunities in Singapore for F&B companies.  Joyce Tee, DBS Group Head of SME Banking, said, “Even though Singaporeans eat well and dine out regularly, our customers tell us that F&B growth opportunities in Singapore are limited due to high manpower and rental costs. As a result, having cut their teeth in Singapore’s competitive F&B scene, they are exploring regional markets to grow their business.”  One such company is Select Group, which has familiar household names such as Peach Garden, Hong Kong Sheng Kee Dessert and Pho Street in its stable of brands. It recently partnered DBS to expand into Jakarta, Indonesia.  Mr Vincent Tan Chor Khoon, Chief Executive Officer of Select Group, and President of the Restaurant Association of Singapore, said that the company’s expansion into Indonesia was smooth as it had an experienced and committed partner in DBS.  “For F&B companies based in Singapore, sometimes, the only way to grow our business is to explore new markets overseas which are growing faster than Singapore. Our regional markets are dynamic and also benefit from fast-growing urban populations which lead to greater purchasing power and easy access to labour. In addition, being a Singapore company also has its benefits as we are known for our dynamic food scene, high standards of quality and hygiene, and that in turn naturally attracts potential customers in new markets,” he said.  Tee added that DBS’ Singapore-based F&B companies’ top three most preferred method of overseas expansion are spearheading the expansion effort themselves (66%), joint ventures (17%) and franchisee licenses (15%), while a small group of companies (2%) prefer to set up a representative office.  Today, F&B regional expansion is growing faster than other traditional industries. While F&B has typically been a domestic industry, the digital economy and revenue from their maturing businesses over the past decade has given F&B SME owners the tools and resources to find expansion opportunities overseas.  DBS has supported the growth and development of regional SMEs with a suite of digital products and services including DBS BusinessClass, a global social network for start-up and SME owners to seek business advice and opportunities; DBS Corporate Multi-Currency Account, where customers can manage up to 13 currencies in a single account; and DBS-Xero partnership, where SME customers can enjoy simplified bill payments. As a testament to the strides DBS has made in its SME digital strategy, today, over 90% of new SME accounts are opened online. For the full year of 2017, SME Banking income grew 11% year on year to a record $1.1 billion.

DBS celebrates the spark in its people with limited-edition jewellery collection,09 Feb 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_celebrates_the_spark_in_its_people_with_limited_edition_jewellery_collection," Singapore, Regional ","- While sharing DBS’ fourth-quarter results at an employee townhall yesterday, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta surprised employees with the announcement of a one-of-a-kind 50th anniversary gift. The bank has commissioned the design of a limited-edition DBS Sparks collection, modelled after the spark found at the heart of the DBS logo, to be gifted to its employees. The collection consists of a pair of 18K gold-plated cufflinks for the men and a necklace for the women. All DBS employees in its 18 markets will receive their gifts by the end of February, and be able to wear the DBS Spark – quite literally on their hearts or their sleeves. Said Karen Ngui, Head of DBS Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, “We believe that our people embody the DBS Spark – that spirit of imagination, that sense of possibility, and the courage to make things happen. It is this very spirit that drives DBS – from our early days as a pioneering force that financed Singapore’s development and spearheaded our nation’s transformation to making our mark across the region. Today, we are not only recognised as Asia’s safest and Asia’s best, but also as the ‘World’s Best Digital Bank’. All this was made possible only through the passion and conviction of our people.” Established in 1968 as the Development Bank of Singapore, DBS began with a purpose like none other – to help finance the industrialisation of Singapore. From the bank’s early days, its employees have been the industry’s trailblazers. For instance, in 1977, the bank launched the Pandan Valley condominium, Singapore’s largest condominium at the time. In 1980, DBS Autosave, the nation’s first interest-bearing current account in Singapore was introduced. In 1985, DBS propelled Singapore Airlines onto the global arena by being the lead manager for their IPO, the first international offering for a locally incorporated company. In 1986, DBS financed the development of Raffles City, paving the way for Singapore to be a leading convention and exhibition destination. DBS today continues its slew of firsts. In 2017, the bank launched POSB Smart Buddy – the world’s first in-school wearable tech savings and payments programme, and has the world’s largest banking API developer platform today. Said Matthew Chow, Senior Associate at DBS Treasures, “I was watching Piyush on the live stream when he told us about the anniversary gifts. I have to say the timing was great, I’ve been wanting a pair of gold cufflinks for a while and this is such a thoughtful yet meaningful surprise.” The DBS Sparks collection was specially commissioned to mark DBS’ golden jubilee and is not available for sale. It is one of several anniversary initiatives to be rolled out in celebration of DBS’ golden jubilee this year. Yesterday, the bank also proposed a special dividend of 50 cents a share to mark the 50th anniversary of DBS. The bank is also capturing the DBS spirit through its award winning mini-series Sparks, which follows a group of dynamic DBS bankers as they navigate the challenges and opportunities at work and in their personal lives. Inspired by real life stories, Sparks demonstrates how Team DBS is driven by a strong sense of purpose and the commitment to always do the right thing by its customers. Since the launch of the mini-series, Sparks has garnered over 110 million views. Viewers can catch all episodes of Sparks including the latest episode, episode eight on https://go.dbs.com/yourspark .

DBS full-year 2017 net profit rises 4% to record SGD 4.39 billion | 繁體,08 Feb 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_full_year_2017_net_profit_rises_4pct_to_record_SGD_4_39_billion," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group’s full-year 2017 net profit rose 4% to a record SGD 4.39 billion. Total income also reached a new high, rising 4% to SGD 11.9 billion from broad-based growth in loans and fee income, which more than offset the impact of a lower net interest margin and weaker trading performance. Productivity gains from digitalisation and cost management initiatives capped expense growth to 3%. The results also included higher allowances due to the accelerated recognition of residual weak oil and gas support service exposures as non-performing assets in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, net profit reached a new quarterly record of SGD 1.22 billion, up 33% from a year ago. Total income rose 10% to SGD 3.06 billion, staying above the SGD 3 billion mark for the second consecutive quarter, as net interest income rose 15% to cross the SGD 2 billion mark for the first time. Total allowances halved. The recent finalisation of Basel capital reforms has provided clarity on future regulatory requirements. They have a benign impact on DBS, enabling its capital requirements to be rationalised. In view of this, the Board suspended the scrip dividend with immediate effect. It also determined that ordinary dividends can be sustained at higher levels and affirmed the policy of increasing them over time in line with earnings growth. For the final dividend of 2017, it proposed a payout of 60 cents per share, which will bring the full-year ordinary dividend to 93 cents per share, an increase of 55% over the previous year. In addition, it proposed a special dividend of 50 cents per share as a one-time return of the capital buffers that had been built up and to mark the fiftieth anniversary of DBS. Full-year earnings up 4% from broad-based growth in business volumes Net interest income rose 7% to SGD 7.79 billion. Loans expanded by an underlying 9% or SGD 25 billion. The growth was broad-based across trade, corporate and consumer loans, with momentum increasing over the course of the year. The consolidation of the Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Taiwan operations of the retail and wealth management businesses acquired from ANZ added another SGD 8 billion of loans, resulting in overall constant-currency loan growth of 11% to SGD 323 billion. Net interest margin fell five basis points to 1.75%, with the brunt of the decline occurring in the first half in line with movements in Singapore-dollar interest rates. Net interest margin stabilised and improved in the second half. Net fee income increased 12% to SGD 2.62 billion. Wealth management fees grew by an underlying 25% to SGD 966 million, led by higher sales of unit trusts and other investment products. Transaction services fees rose 6% to SGD 618 million from growth in cash management income. Investment banking fees rose 14% to SGD 216 million from higher fixed income and equity market activities. Card fees also increased. Other non-interest income fell 18% to SGD 1.51 billion from a decline in trading income and the impact of a net gain on fixed assets in the previous year. Income from treasury customer products fell 3% to SGD 1.15 billion. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income grew 9% to SGD 4.67 billion as all product segments were higher. Wealth Management customer segment income grew 25% to SGD 2.11 billion as assets under management rose 24% to SGD 206 billion. Institutional Banking income was stable at SGD 5.28 billion as an increase in cash management income was offset by lower income from other activities. Trading-related income for Treasury Markets fell 24% to SGD 856 million. Expenses amounted to SGD 5.13 billion as productivity gains from digitalisation and cost management initiatives contained cost growth to 3%. The amount also included costs from the consolidated ANZ operations from the second half. The cost-income ratio stayed at 43%. Profit before allowances increased 4% to SGD 6.79 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings up 33% from year ago For the fourth quarter, net profit rose 33% from a year ago to SGD 1.22 billion. Total income increased 10% to SGD 3.06 billion as double-digit percentage increases in net interest income and fee income were partially offset by a decline in other non-interest income. Net interest income increased 15% to SGD 2.10 billion. Net interest margin rose seven basis points to 1.78% in line with higher Singapore-dollar interest rates. Loans, including those from the consolidation of ANZ, rose 11% in constant-currency terms. Net fee income grew 23% to SGD 636 million. The increase was across most fee income streams and led by wealth management and investment banking. Other non-interest income fell 26% to SGD 322 million as weaker trading income was partially offset by an increase in net gain on investment securities. Expenses increased 11% to SGD 1.36 billion due to higher marketing and technology costs as well as the consolidation of ANZ. Profit before allowances rose 9% to SGD 1.70 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings up 48% from the previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, fourth-quarter net profit was 48% higher as total allowances fell by two-thirds to more normalised levels. Business momentum remained strong, with total income maintained at the previous quarter’s record despite seasonally lower non-interest income. Net interest income rose 6% as underlying loans increased 3% from broad-based growth in trade, corporate and housing loans; including the consolidation of the Taiwan operations of ANZ, loans rose 4% in constant-currency terms. Net interest margin of 1.78% was five basis points higher from the repricing of Singapore-dollar and Hong Kong-dollar loans. Fee income fell 7% from the record in the previous quarter due to seasonally slower wealth management and loan-related activities. Other non-interest income was 19% lower from weaker trading income. Expenses were 8% higher from higher marketing and technology costs. Profit before allowances declined 6%. Balance sheet remains strong The NPL rate was unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.7%. Allowance coverage was prudent at 85% and at 173% when collateral was considered. Total allowances for the full year were 8% higher at SGD 1.54 billion. A 61% increase in specific allowances to SGD 2.40 billion due to the accelerated recognition of weak oil and gas support service exposures as non-performing assets in the third quarter was partially offset by general allowance write-backs. Excluding these exposures, specific allowances for the full year were SGD 552 million. Deposits rose 11% from a year ago and 4% from the previous quarter in constant-currency terms to SGD 374 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio for the fourth quarter was 131%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the regulatory requirement due in 2018. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was at 14.3%, up 0.3% points from the previous quarter, from an increase in retained earnings. The leverage ratio of 7.6% was more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “The record fourth quarter rounds off a strong full-year performance driven by broad-based growth in loans and fee income, which more than offset the impact of less favourable interest rates and trading income. The results attest to the quality of the multiple business engines we have built and the nimbleness of our execution. We enter the coming year with sustained momentum across our businesses and, more fundamentally, in our digital transformation. The significant increase in dividends reflects the quality of our earnings, the strength of our balance sheet and the improved returns we are generating for shareholders.” [End] About DBS  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS shares sustainability commitments addressing climate change,26 Jan 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_shares_sustainability_commitments_addressing_climate_change," Singapore, Regional ","- With 2018 being Singapore’s Year of Climate Action, DBS today shared four areas the bank has been focussing on that support sustainable development and address climate change. Last year, the bank established the DBS Sustainability Council and appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) to ensure that its approach to sustainability would be relevant and viable. The council and CSO were tasked with developing DBS’ overarching sustainability framework, setting KPIs and targets, and driving sustainability initiatives across the bank. Said DBS CEO, Piyush Gupta, “We recognise our role in promoting sustainable development, including the transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change affects us all and we seek to do our part to ensure a clean energy future. It is with this in mind that we have pledged to support Singapore’s ‘Year of Climate Action’. I believe that our commitments will result in substantial impact in the years to come.” The bank has been making traction in the following focus areas to address climate change: 1. Managing own environmental footprint In November 2017, DBS became a signatory to RE100 – the first Asian bank and Singapore company to join the global renewable energy initiative. The bank committed to using 100% renewable energy for its Singapore operations by 2030, and has begun the transition by installing solar panels on its Changi Business Park building. The bank has also committed to maintaining the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Platinum rating – the highest rating – for its offices, and also aims to achieve the BCA Green Mark Certification for all its Singapore retail branches. 2. Promoting sustainable finance In 2017, DBS was the sole bookrunner for the first green bond issued in Singapore. In the same year, the bank also issued its own maiden USD 500 million green bond to the international debt market – Singapore’s first green bond by a financial institution. DBS has also begun to introduce ESG funds on its product shelves and is exploring ways to create awareness and encourage green consumer behavior through its product offerings. 3. Responsible financing In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore released guidelines to ensure banks systematically integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their lending decision-making. DBS has since introduced a set of comprehensive ESG policies and procedures. In addition, DBS will stop financing new greenfield coal fired power generation projects in OECD/developed markets. In developing countries, DBS will change its focus to more efficient technologies. Going forward, the bank will also cease all project financing of greenfield thermal coal mines. 4. Committing to transparent disclosures DBS is among the some 240 global companies that committed to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), on voluntary disclosures around climate-related risks and opportunities. The Task Force’s recommendations will help secure more complete, meaningful, reliable and consistent data across all companies and sectors for climate-related financial disclosures. This provides stakeholders with more meaningful and transparent climate-related financial information, enabling market forces to drive efficient allocation of capital and support a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy.

DBS to help SMEs simplify bill payments,23 Jan 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_help_SMEs_simplify_bill_payments, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank and Xero today announced that they have expanded their partnership to help SMEs simplify bill payments by launching an industry-first online payments solution to help start-ups and SMEs manage their cashflow needs better.  The DBS-Xero payment solution addresses payment problems among SMEs caused by finance-related concerns such as cash flow problems. This is an issue which plagues more than 1 in 3 SMEs in Singapore[1]. The new payments solution is a straight-through one as it eliminates an SME’s administrative burden of having to manually enter payment details on multiple platforms, which could potentially lead to costly human errors during the process. With this API[2]-driven banking service, payments can be initiated on Xero and approved through the bank’s corporate internet banking platform, DBS IDEAL, all in a few clicks. SMEs form the backbone of the Singapore economy. 99% of the companies incorporated in Singapore are SMEs, who in turn employ more than 80% of the workforce. Joyce Tee, DBS Group Head of SME Banking said, “SMEs have so much on their plate, they grapple daily with challenges such as rising manpower costs, hiring difficulties and fast-changing market dynamics. And so, it is more important than ever that they manage their cashflow effectively. A payments solution like the one we are launching today means that SMEs can now have a real-time view of their cash position which in turn allows them to up their productivity and tap into the latest business opportunities.” DBS and Xero’s new payments solution will be made available to existing DBS-Xero customers in Singapore at no cost. The bank also plans to introduce this solution to SMEs in Hong Kong by the end of the year. The launch of this solution also marks the next step in regional strategic partnership between DBS and Xero to enable SMEs to transform their businesses using technology.  Making payments are traditionally a tedious paper-intensive process that take up the bulk of SME owners’ time. “Small businesses all around the world, who adopt new technology and digitise the way they work to drive growth, can now expect to manage cash flow and access capital in entirely new ways,” commented Alex Campbell, Managing Director Asia at Xero. “With DBS, we have found the perfect partner for enabling small businesses to achieve exactly that across the Asia region. This new payment service is another milestone in building our financial network of trusted organisations and institutions sharing financial data securely with the purpose of helping our more than one million small business customers do business easier via Xero’s global platform and their banks.” In recent years, DBS has helped many SMEs go digital, helping them save time and costs. In 2017, nine in ten new SME accounts were opened online.  This has led to a 2.5 times increase in customers using DBS IDEAL to make online payments to vendors and suppliers. DBS has also reduced the cost of making payments online by 90% so that SMEs benefit from cheaper online payments. Mr Keyis Ng, CEO and Co-Founder of Cafebond.com said, “Being a business owner in Singapore is challenging, but having the right tools and partners makes it easier. I’m excited to try out the new online payment service by DBS and Xero. By getting rid of the administrative tedium and creating a more efficient invoicing, payments and collections process, I’ll have more time to focus on what we do best, which is sharing the love of specialty coffee with our customers across Asia.” Cafebond.com was one of the start-ups that took part in DBS’ Hotspot Accelerator Programme in 2016, and received mentorship, access to investors as well as free workshops and skills enablement classes. “As a bank that supports and finances over 60% of SMEs in Singapore, we are committed to empowering business owners by making banking simpler, faster and more convenient for them,” said Tee.  1 DP Information Group - SME Development Survey 2017 2 Application programming interface [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS launches World’s first online simulation tool to help CFOs and corporate treasures design and derive optimised cash management solutions | 繁體,18 Jan 2018,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_Worlds_first_online_simulation_tool__to_help_CFOs_and_corporate_treasures_design_and_derive_optimised_cash_management_solutions, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong ) last week successfully debuted DBS Treasury Prism, the world’s first online treasury and cash management simulation tool to over 100 CFOs, corporate treasurers and finance controllers from large and multinational corporations in Hong Kong. Users are able to simulate various bank and corporate solutions on DBS Treasury Prism ( treasuryprism.dbs.com ) at no cost, and review potential opportunities that will maximise value for their enterprise. CFOs and corporate treasurers often manage several accounts with different currencies and transaction flows across multiple countries. As a result, they often engage a few different banks to help create an optimal treasury and cash management solution. The process in doing so, called a Request for Proposal, is often time-consuming, unproductive and tedious. Using a human-centred design approach, DBS uncovered five critical areas to address through in-depth interviews with over 50 CFOs, corporate treasurers and finance professionals. These problems include: Too much preparatory work to achieve an optimal solution Difficulty in monetising or quantifying the benefits and costs of solutions proposed by different banks No time to keep up with the latest regulatory, tax and market changes Too much effort to work with stakeholders on a new cash management solution Difficulty in implementing new and complex solutions DBS Treasury Prism was custom-built to address these challenges by giving CFOs and corporate treasurers the ability to independently experiment with cash and liquidity management structures and analyse the relative benefits and costs. The bank-agnostic platform takes into account the regulatory and tax environment in the markets where the company operates in, and offers immediate and contextual insights to help them understand the implications that each solution has on the business. Users can create simulations of account and liquidity structures across multiple markets and compare each solution through a quantified assessment of its cost and benefits. The combination of digital solutioning and contextual insights results in a value-rich experience for treasurers as they explore potential opportunities and solutions. Soh Fern Boey, Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Services, Hong Kong, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong), said, “The rapidly shifting technological and regulatory landscapes that are driving the evolution of the corporate treasurer mean increased demand for speed, efficiency and transparency in cross-border cash management solutions. We developed DBS Treasury Prism to be an innovative and intuitive enabler to help corporate treasurers in their work, such as instantly getting information on country regulations and central bank rules, and reducing the time needed to perform basic checks on possible cross-border cash management solutions.” Mark Troutman, Global Transaction Services’ Head of Sales at DBS Bank, said, “We believe DBS Treasury Prism is a good example of how we are leveraging digital technology to help CFOs and corporate treasurers meet elevated expectations for cash management solutions. DBS Treasury Prism is a product of innovation and customer-centred digital engagement, and will help shape the partnership between transaction bankers and treasury and finance professionals well beyond the conventional bank-customer interaction.” Some of the key features of DBS Treasury Prism include: Building simulations and quantifying benefits Treasurers often receive multiple cash management proposals from banks; determining the best solution is challenging as the benefits are not always clearly evident. DBS Treasury Prism empowers treasurers by enabling them to simulate various structures for a range of international currencies, taking into account the tax and regulatory implications across 24 countries including key financial centres in Asia, Europe and the US. Each simulation features an Optimisation Score derived from a smart algorithm that takes into account the interest yield and debt, tax, bank fees and corporate costs, helping users quantify the benefits of each structure. The dynamic online platform is equipped with over 30 liquidity and transactional flow management tools, including bank solutions and corporate tools such as interest optimisation, notional pooling, instant payments, and payments and receivables management, all supported by real time insights. In addition, the platform has an 'Optimise' feature that recommends alternative structures for users to explore and consider. Access to contextual insights in real time Keeping up-to-date with the latest changes in regulations and tax is time-consuming and challenging. The platform solves this problem by pulling current tax and regulation updates across 24 countries globally, providing users with contextual insights in real time as they create simulations. DBS Treasury Prism also features a Knowledge Centre with articles on emerging trends, new solutions and the latest market practices in treasury and cash management, giving treasurers a full breadth of information. Building the global transaction services business is one of the bank’s strategic priorities, and today, it constitutes 31% of the bank’s institutional banking business income. In particular, cash management services have grown from strength to strength. DBS was also named Best Transaction Bank, Asia by The Asset, and Best Overall Bank for Cash Management, Asia Pacific by Global Finance in 2017.

Do you want to start a business? Check These 5 Things You Need to Know to Start a Business | Bahasa,22 Dec 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Do_you_want_to_start_a_business_Check_These_5_Things_You_Need_to_Know_to_Start_a_Business, Indonesia ,"- Startups are gaining popularity among Indonesian youths. But what actually is a startup? A startup is a young company that is just beginning to develop and is still finding its niche in the market. Indonesia is among the top five countries in the world with the highest number of startups, according to Startup Ranking. At the beginning of 2018, there were a total of 1,705 startups in Indonesia, placing Indonesia at number four after the United States (28,794 startups), India (4,713 startups), and the United Kingdom (2,971 startups). Most of the founders of the startups are members of Generation Y. Interested in starting a business? Let’s review these 5 things you need to know to start a business. 1. Start with a Simple Idea Starting a business is certainly a big challenge. We can start a business with a simple idea related to our daily problems. When starting a business, don't get fixated with trends because there are competitors in business trends that are still taking shape. This means we must have creative, unique ideas to stand out from other startups. 2. Determine Market Analysis and Target Audience Analysis of the market and target audience is one of the important things that determine the success of a business. We must understand the needs that other businesses cannot fulfill and to exist as a business that can provide better services for the public. After determining the target audience, we can do market analysis, including an analysis of competitors and our target audience. Through market analysis we can monitor the development of other companies that are engaged in a similar business and their strategies. 2. Follow a Timeline Discipline is what leads to a business success. It can be achieved by determining what needs to be done and prioritizing what must be achieved in a certain period of time to measure business development. 4. Join Business Classes and Workshops At times, we feel the urge to start a business but refrain from meeting the urge out of fear. There are many factors behind our hesitation, such as a lack of understanding of the industry, the market, or even the steps that must be taken to start a business, resulting in a lack of confidence in starting a business. Joining classes and workshops on startups will help us learn more and get inspiration from forerunners who have successfully run their businesses. DBS BusinessClass can be one of the programs for those planning to start and have just started a business. DBS BusinessClass is a program designed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to help entrepreneurs develop their business through business support programs. We can hone in our skills together with business specialists and share our knowledge with communities across Asia. 5. Partner with Banks Starting a business actually requires mature ideas and strategies. However, a business will not run well without adequate financing. Making accurate financial forecasts to ensure profit growth is a common problem among startups. Therefore, partnership with banks can be a solution so that we can focus on realizing out business plan. In addition to the five things to consider in building a startup, human resources productivity and efficiency are equally important. A five-member startup won’t need an accountant and can use accounting software instead. A last resort to be considered is the use of digital banking for the company's financial needs to save costs and time that could be dedicated to growing the business. ""Some of the things that can be done by startup players in making accurate income forecasts is by managing business expenses more efficiently. One example is the use of co-working space that is more cost-efficient than renting an office space in an office building. Co-working space not just cuts cost but is also useful in opening opportunities to meet other business people to expand network,"" said Rudy Tandjung, Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia.  ***  About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS Bank accelerates digitalisation transformation with robotics programme,30 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_accelerates_digitalisation_transformation_with_robotics_programme, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank and IBM today announced they are working together to scale an enterprise-wide Centre of Excellence (COE) in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), making it the first-of-its-kind large-scale implementation in the financial services sector in Singapore and the region. In June, IBM helped DBS set up the COE. Since then, DBS has already optimised more than 50 complex business processes across the bank. Having commenced in Singapore, the RPA programme will now be progressively implemented in other markets including Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. Every day, financial organisations perform thousands of time-intensive business processes and manual tasks, which may contribute to rising operating expenses, low employee productivity, high error rates, and reduced speed-to-market. However, software robots (robots) are transforming these mundane activities using a style of automation where a software programme can help to manage and execute a wide range of repetitive, rules-based tasks that require handling high volumes of structured data. These robots also have the capacity to operate 24/7, allowing organisations to remain operational outside of standard working hours and maintain operational efficiencies. Soh Siew Choo, Managing Director, Technology and Operations, DBS said, “As the region's leading digital bank, DBS is committed to delivering innovative and unique experiences for our customers and employees, which are critically dependent on the flexibility of our bank's processes. Cognitive and robotics process automation is an important capability that will help with the necessary speed and agility to meet the rapidly changing demands of customers and the evolving financial services marketplace.” With an enterprise-wide automation strategy and technologies such as RPA, organisations are now enabled with new technologies that can help scale and manage workload with ease and free up existing employees to spend more time on strategic tasks. This results in businesses having more time to focus on improving customer engagement, innovation and accelerating transformation within the business. According to research conducted by leading analyst firm Forrester, it is estimated that by 2019, process automation will change up to 25% of the work associated with all job categories [1] . Soh said, “We selected IBM as our partner to provide end-to-end services for implementing and maintaining the RPA programme as a COE, given their deep and historically successful experience of enabling process automation and developing transformational capabilities for the banking industry.” Adam Lawrence, Managing Director, IBM said, “Disruptive innovation has become a regular occurrence. While the ability to automate processes has existed for a very long time, technology has since evolved to enable cognitive automation through autonomous decision-making, new insights through data discovery, and personalised support.” Chandra Somani, Lead Consulting Partner, IBM, added, “While many companies are still experimenting with robotics, DBS has taken a bold enterprise-wide approach as part of its ongoing digitalisation journey. IBM has been helping DBS with not only RPA programmme but also incorporating embedded analytics, machine learning and a whole ecosystem of capabilities such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies to simplify, streamline and automate end-to-end business and operational processes.” [1]  http://blogs.forrester.com/jp_gownder/15-08-24-robots_wont_steal_all_the_jobs_but_theyll_transform_the_way_we_work [END] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

With millions of active customers worldwide, AWS was named a Leader in Gartner’s June 2017 Magic Quadrant for Infrastructure as a Service, Worldwide for the seventh consecutive year. The collaboration reinforces DBS’ commitment to being at the forefront of banking, and is in alignment with the Singapore government’s Smart Nation Agenda. DBS, named the World’s Best Digital Bank at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence in 2016, announced in August that it would invest SGD 20 million over five years to transform employees into a digital workforce, enabling them to thrive in the digital economy and adapt to the future of work.

Annual ASEAN green investment needs to grow 400% to guard against environmental risks,15 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Annual_ASEAN_green_investment_needs_to_grow_400pct_to_guard_against_environmental_risks," Singapore, Regional ","- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region needs to increase green investment by 400 per cent each year to protect its people and economies from climate change and other environmental shocks, according to new research released today. Green Finance Opportunities in ASEAN , produced by financial services group DBS and the UN Environment Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System, finds that USD 3 trillion in green investment is needed between 2016 and 2030. This represents a new ASEAN green investment market 37 times the size of the global 2016 green bond market. “ASEAN is undergoing transformational changes as it adapts to climate change and pivots towards a more sustainable path of development,” said Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer of DBS. “At DBS, we believe there is no trade-off between promoting sustainable development and value creation for our shareholders – green finance can be good business too.” Humanity’s high-carbon, resource-intensive growth path has damaged both people and planet. Pollution, natural resource depletion and climate change bring significant economic stresses that policymakers historically have not accounted for, or properly addressed, in development plans. Asian Development Bank (ADB) research shows that ASEAN members are more exposed to such risks than the global average – down to significant poverty rates, economic dependence on environmentally sensitive industries, geographic vulnerability to climate effects, and rapid population growth. To reduce its vulnerability, and provide long-term economic stability and prosperity, the ASEAN region needs put itself on a sustainable trajectory. This will require substantial amounts of green investment. “Green investment in the ASEAN region can transform the region into a green economic powerhouse that supports a growing population, and provides returns for investors,” said Dr. Ma Jun, UN Environment’s Special Advisor on Sustainable Finance and Co-chair of G20 Green Finance Study Group. “This report lays out ways in which the ASEAN region can unlock this investment and protect its people, environment and economies.” The investment opportunity Current annual ASEAN flows of green finance are estimated at USD 40 billion, against an average annual need of roughly USD 200 billion to 2030 – which adds up to the estimated total USD 3 trillion. This investment is spread across infrastructure (USD 1,800 billion), renewable energy (USD 400 billion), energy efficiency (USD 400 billion) and food, agriculture and land use (USD 400 billion). Indonesia will require the largest volume of green finance. Substantial investment opportunities also exist in Thailand and Vietnam. Approximately 75 per cent of current flows comes from public finance and 25 per cent from private finance, largely in the form of commercial loans. Future public contributions are anticipated to drop to around 40 per cent. This means that private green finance flows will need to scale up by a factor of over ten to meet the demand. Investments should be made according to the unique characteristics of the ASEAN region. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are widespread across markets that are highly diverse in terms of economic attributes, culture, language and religion. Barriers to success The report identifies several barriers to scaling up green finance. These include:  Many of the SMEs that dominate ASEAN economies have issues accessing finance, which could be used for green investment in improving environmental performance, expanding sales of green goods and services, and reshaping the practices of agricultural smallholders. There is insufficient environmental disclosure from companies, and limited information-sharing platforms. This makes it more difficult for financial decision makers to identify, price and manage environmental risk. The pipeline of commercially viable green investment opportunities is relatively limited. Exchange rate volatility across the ten ASEAN member currencies is singled out as a significant barrier to ASEAN green investment. National environmental and broader sustainability objectives have not been translated into coherent financial policy frameworks. Solutions to increase green investment No single solution set will deliver the green finance required in ASEAN. However, the report finds several areas that would benefit from further exploration.  Developing green investment platforms would support the collaboration required for many green investments. Investors with medium- to long-term liability profiles, such as insurance companies or pension funds, could help scale up green investment by lending directly to green projects with longer-term investment needs and purchasing green assets channelled by banks into the capital markets. Initiatives could be undertaken to develop voluntary environment-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing relevant information to investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders. A deeper green investment asset pipeline could be developed, through aggregation of assets into financial products, use of public funds, and new financial products such as forms of environmental insurance. Digital finance offers promising avenues to connect SME users of green finance to lower cost sources through a growing range of intermediaries, such as mobile or crowdfunding platforms. Green finance roadmaps could enhance the ability of the financial system to mobilize green finance. These long-term, systemic plans involve identifying system-wide needs, barriers to scaling and priority actions. To download the full report, visit go.dbs.com/ASEANgreenfinance . NOTES TO EDITORS The Inquiry is a leading international platform for advancing national and international efforts to shift the trillions required for delivering an inclusive, green economy through the transformation of the global financial system. Since launching in 2014, the Inquiry has worked with more than twenty countries on national processes, published around 90 reports and working papers and serves as the Secretariat for the G20’s Green Finance Study Group. The Inquiry and partners are this week launching another three reports on the state of play in green and sustainable finance and upcoming investment opportunities. These are: 13 November – Roadmap on Sustainable Finance , with the World Bank Group. This report is aimed at helping governments and the private sector design a global financial system that is fit-for-purpose in the era of sustainable development. 15 November – Singapore Roadmap on Green Finance , with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. This report looks at how Singapore could transform itself into a green finance hub for ASEAN and the wider region. 16 November – China Green Finance Progress Report , with the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing. This is the first published review of progress in China on green finance set against the State Council’s 35 recommendations on green finance adopted in August 2016. All reports and related infographics can be downloaded from the Inquiry’s website on the relevant dates.

First bank in Singapore to launch new cloud-based data centre,13 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/First_bank_in_Singapore_to_launch_new_cloud_based_data_centre, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced a partnership with leading data centre provider, Equinix [1] , to transform one of its traditional data centres in Singapore into a cloud-optimised centre. This new initiative will enable the bank to move its main data centre to significantly smaller premises, which are a quarter of the size of its existing data centre. This will make the new centre 75% cheaper to run. The bank is able to reap these benefits as it has been working on migrating to cloud-optimised technology in recent years, resulting in huge efficiency saves while increasing storage and computing capacity by 7x since 2014. The expertise built up in this time has culminated in it being able to run a more efficient technology architecture and infrastructure, resulting in massive cost savings for the bank. With growing business volumes and digitalisation, compute workloads at the bank have doubled in the last three years and are expected to see continued significant growth. The Equinix collaboration will further fortify DBS’ cloud infrastructure and improve the bank’s ability to be even more agile and scalable. It will also contribute towards advancing the bank’s sustainability agenda by improving energy efficiency by at least 10 times. DBS is an early adopter of cloud technology and has announced that it would shift 50% of its compute workload to the public cloud by 2018. Last year, the bank launched cloud partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Pivotal Cloud Foundry, empowering it to innovate and operate at start-up speeds. It has also leveraged Microsoft’s cloud-based productivity technology, Office 365, in the workplace, enabling employees to change the way they work, making a leap forward in terms of mobility, efficiency and productivity. As a result, DBS today operates in a hybrid cloud environment, which is optimised for rapid changes of capacity and functionality. The banks’ aggressive drive towards cloud technology for its applications underlines its commitment to digitally transform the bank from client facing functions all the way to backend processes. This will enable the bank to better serve its customers who increasingly prefer to transact digitally [2] . David Gledhill, DBS’ Group Chief Information Officer and Head of Technology and Operations said, “By being a leader in adopting cloud technologies, DBS can deliver more customer value through our ability to experiment and scale quickly. Our teams are able to iterate and deliver products to our customers at a much faster rate, while adhering to the highest standards of security and resiliency. With the new cloud data centre, we are able to significantly increase our energy efficiency as well as drastically reduce our carbon footprint.” Last month, DBS joined RE100, a global renewable energy campaign that brings together influential global businesses committed to using 100% renewable energy to power their operations. This is a first for an Asian bank. DBS has set a target to power 100% of its Singapore operations using renewable energy by 2030. Earlier this year, DBS launched Singapore’s first green bond by a financial institution, with proceeds going towards financing green projects. DBS was also the first Asian bank to have its global international express shipments carbon neutral. In addition, DBS became the first bank to achieve the Green Mark certification endorsed by the National Environment Agency and received the certification for over 20 branches, with two branches awarded the Gold Plus Green Mark Award. The bank was also conferred the BCA Green Mark Platinum and Gold Award for its office buildings at Marina Bay Financial Centre and Changi Business Park earlier this year.

"DBS reimagines banking with lifestyle space for ""tech"" generation",10 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_reimagines_banking_with_lifestyle_space_for_tech_generation, Singapore ,"- In its continued journey to reimagine banking, DBS has launched a lifestyle space for the tech generation where digital banking is complemented by human connection. Designed with a “café and branch” concept, the new lifestyle space at Plaza Singapura features an open layout, creating a relaxed atmosphere. Customers are first welcomed by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee at the entrance of the branch, where Bettr Barista, a social enterprise supported by the DBS Foundation, stands. The new lifestyle space is designed with the tech generation in mind and also offers them a highly digital experience to meet their banking and lifestyle needs. It features an industry-first VR corner for retirement planning, where customers will be guided on how to go about working towards their retirement lifestyles. At the branch, customers can perform both cash deposits and withdrawals at the Cash Services Machines – the machines also allow cash withdrawals above their ATM card limit. DBS/POSB has deployed close to 90 of these machines in more than 30 different locations across the island. Since the introduction of the Cash Services Machines, over-the-counter cash transactions have decreased by around 48% and 22% for retail and corporate customers respectively, highlighting its convenience.  Besides the cash machines, banking services are also accessible to customers round-the-clock through Video Teller Machines (VTMs), offering them non-cash banking services such as the issuance or replacement of internet banking tokens or debit cards. Customers who require help are able to access instant ‘face-to-face’ assistance via live video. Pepper, the humanoid robot, is also on hand to guide customers on how to use the VTMs. There are currently 13 VTMs in 12 locations in Singapore and the bank plans to install more than 20 machines by the end of 2017. DBS will also transform this lifestyle space to allow customers to interact with one another based on their interests. For a start, together with *SCAPE, DBS is organising a talent development showcase to groom budding singing talents, culminating in the first-ever National Youth Music Awards competition in 2018. There are also plans to hold monthly latte art and coffee appreciation classes with Bettr Barista, financial talks by NAV – Your Financial GPS and art work exhibitions by students. Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, said “Banking services have a ‘clicks and mortar’ element, where digital banking and human connection complement each other. Over the last few years, we have both expanded and further integrated our physical and digital channels to enable our customers to access our services seamlessly across multiple touchpoints. In short, customers choose the platform they are most comfortable with, be it on a face-to-face basis, digitally on the mobile or internet, or a combination of both.” He added, “We also believe social networking in a physical space is equally important and that is why we are transforming this lifestyle branch to allow customers to interact with one another based on their interests. By reimagining banking, we want to change the impression of what branch banking is for the tech generation – hence offering this new relaxed environment, where banking is woven into our customers’ daily lives.” DBS is also launching TwentyThirty ( www.twentyxthirty.com ), an online initiative for young adults – a hub that provides quality content that is of relevance to everyday living. TwentyThirty will cover a variety of topics, from getting through adulting milestones and financial literacy, to career advice and everything else that may be important for a balanced life. DBS’ aim is to engage young adults in their 20s and 30s in conversations about larger “life” issues, and embark on a continuous process of providing valuable information that directly addresses their jobs to be done. DBS will continue to engage the young adult segment with enhanced products and services, activations and partnerships with like-minded brands. To cater to the financial aspirations of young adults in Singapore, DBS has ecently launched the enhanced DBS Multiplier Account, making it easier for them to qualify for higher interest rates on their account balances by lowering the transaction threshold, with no minimum salary crediting amount and no minimum credit card spend.

DBS Hong Kong and Xero launch first-of-its-kind innovative cloud accounting solution to transform how SMEs manage finances,08 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_HONG_KONG_AND_XERO_LAUNCH_FIRST_OF_ITS_KIND_INNOVATIVE_CLOUD_ACCOUNTING_SOLUTION, Hong Kong ,"- In a first-of-its-kind collaboration in Hong Kong, DBS Bank (Hong Kong), a leader in SME banking 1 , and Xero, a leading global cloud accounting platform, today jointly announced the launch of an innovative API-driven solution to transform how business owners in Hong Kong manage their finances, and ultimately, make payments and apply for loans seamlessly. This landmark collaboration will save small business owners in Hong Kong a significant amount of time by allowing them to easily connect their DBS business bank accounts to Xero, so that their transaction data can flow securely and automatically into Xero each day. In less than a day, business owners will get a reliable, up-to-date view of their financial position in Xero, empowering them to make more informed business and investment decisions, without the hassle and costly mistakes caused by outdated cash flow balances and human error. A survey of 151 small businesses in Hong Kong conducted by Colmar Burton in October 2017 found that: On average, Hong Kong’s small business owners spend an average of 16.5 hours a month manually importing and reconciling their bank statements Of these, almost a third (32%) spend between 20 and 50 hours a month manually reconciling Over two-thirds of small businesses (69%) cited manual bank statement reconciliation as a key challenge in managing their operations Of these, 19% cited this as the single biggest financial challenge facing their business The online integration is the first of its kind in Hong Kong and follows the announcement of a regional partnership between DBS and Xero in March this year. DBS worked closely with Xero to build a completely seamless online experience that eliminates the need for SMEs to spend time doing manual data entry or importing bank transactions. SME customers using DBS IDEALTM, DBS’ online business banking platform, can opt to have their bank transactions imported automatically into their nominated Xero subscription every day, with bank feeds available the following day. Unlike other banks in the region with direct bank feed integration with Xero, which use a manual paper-based setup for bank feeds (can take up to 10 days for processing), the DBS integration has quickly become the gold standard to empower SMEs to use their data in meaningful ways. Alex Cheung, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Banking Group, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “DBS has been at the forefront of providing digital solutions to our SME customers. This collaboration is one of the first in an exciting series of digital solutions we are working with Xero to bring true efficiency gains and new insights to our SME customers. As a leader in SME banking, DBS Hong Kong understands the needs of SME customers. We offer customised and innovative solutions to support SMEs for sustainable growth.” Joyce Tee, DBS Group Head of SME Banking, said, “We have made it a priority to reimagine banking, seamlessly interweave banking into a customer’s everyday life by being part of their eco-system and provide SMEs with business management tools to help them grow their business. By enabling SMEs to manage their finances in a much more efficient manner, we hope that they can better manage their business and make more informed decisions.” Soh Fern Boey, Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Services, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “The collaboration between DBS IDEALTM and Xero’s cloud accounting platform is a great example of how we are leveraging technology to create a more intuitive, efficient and seamless banking experience for SME customers. There is no need to line up at bank counters or submit paper forms to sign up, as a one-time online registration is all that is needed. Account information will be available within 24 hours in Xero’s secured cloud environment, providing a consolidated financial position for decisive business planning.” Alex Campbell, Xero’s Managing Director for Asia, said, “As one of the world’s recognised leading digital banks, DBS is a natural partner for Xero to collaborate with to develop game-changing solutions for the financial management challenges that small businesses face every day. The launch of direct bank feeds is a foundational first step to further innovative, technology solutions from Xero and DBS for Hong Kong’s small businesses."" DBS-Xero direct bank feeds are available free to all DBS business account customers who are Xero subscribers. New Xero customers who connect their DBS business accounts to Xero will get 3 months’ free subscription. New DBS customers who connect their business accounts with Xero will enjoy DBS IDEALTM monthly service fee waivers and online banking telegraphic transfer transactions fee waivers for 3 months.

"DBS third-quarter earnings at SGD 822 million, quarterly total income crosses SGD 3 billion for first time | 繁體",06 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_third_quarter_earnings_at_SGD_822_Million_quarterly_total_income_crosses_SGD_3_Billion_for_first_time," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group Holdings reported net profit of SGD 822 million for third-quarter 2017. Net allowances of SGD 815 million were taken as residual weak oil and gas support services exposures were classified as non-performing assets (NPAs). Business momentum remained strong as quarterly total income crossed SGD 3 billion for the first time, rising 4% from a year ago to SGD 3.06 billion. Profit before allowances rose 4% to a record SGD 1.80 billion. For the nine months, total income and profit before allowances were also at new highs from broad-based growth in loan volumes and fee income, which more than offset the impact of softer Singapore-dollar interest rates and weaker trading income. The higher third-quarter allowances resulted in a 5% decline in nine-month net profit to SGD 3.17 billion. Residual weak oil and gas support service exposures recognised as NPAs The Group’s exposure to the oil and gas support services sector amounted to SGD 5.3 billion, less than 2% of its overall loan portfolio. Consistent with the assessment of the sector provided in second-quarter 2017, and taking into account the impending implementation of Financial Reporting Standard 109, the Group accelerated the recognition of the residual weak cases as NPAs with a commensurate increase in specific allowances, while drawing SGD 850 million from general allowance reserves, resulting in a net allowance charge of SGD 815 million for the quarter. The step removes uncertainty about the asset quality outlook. As at 30 September 2017, oil and gas support services non-performing assets amounted to SGD 3.0 billion, for which cumulative specific allowances of SGD 1.5 billion have been made. The specific allowances have been taken after applying significant haircuts to collateral valuations, which were further reduced during the quarter. General allowance reserves continued to be healthy at SGD 2.6 billion, which were in excess of both the 1% general allowance requirement by the MAS and the amount that would have to be set aside under FRS 109 from 1 January 2018. The overall NPL rate rose from 1.5% in the previous quarter to 1.7%. Overall allowance coverage remained prudent at 83% and at 171% when collateral was considered. Strong business momentum as third-quarter total income crosses SGD 3 billion Third-quarter business momentum was strong. Total income rose 4% from a year ago to SGD 3.06 billion. A 9% increase in net interest income and 12% rise in fee income were partially offset by an 20% decline in other non-interest income. Net interest income increased 9% to SGD 1.98 billion. Loans rose 8% or SGD 24 billion to SGD 314 billion, which included SGD 6 billion from the consolidation of the Singapore, Hong Kong and China operations of the wealth management and retail banking business acquired from ANZ. Underlying growth was broad-based across corporate, trade and Singapore housing loans. Net interest margin was four basis points lower at 1.73%. Net fee income rose 12% to SGD 685 million from broad-based growth. Higher sales of unit trusts and other investment products resulted in a double-digit percentage increase in wealth management fees to SGD 272 million. Investment banking fees rose 19% to SGD 64 million from higher advisory income. Transaction banking fees grew 5% to SGD 154 million from higher cash management income. Other non-interest income fell 20% to SGD 399 million due to lower trading income as well as the impact of a SGD 41 million property disposal gain a year ago. These declines were partially offset by higher gains on investment securities. Expenses rose 5% to SGD 1.26 billion and the cost-income ratio was stable from a year ago at 41%. Profit before allowances increased 4% to SGD 1.80 billion. Total income up 5% from previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, total income was 5% higher, led by growth in net interest income and fee income. With expenses little changed, profit before allowances increased 9%. Net interest income rose 5% as loans increased 4% from broad-based underlying growth as well as the consolidation of ANZ. Underlying loans expanded 2% from sustained corporate and housing loan growth momentum. Net interest margin was stable. Fee income was 8% higher from increases in wealth management, investment banking and cards income. Other non-interest income was stable as higher gains on investment securities were offset by weaker trading income. Nine-month total income rises 2% to new high For the nine months, total income rose 2% to a new high of SGD 8.87 billion. Increases in net interest income and fee income were partially offset by a decline in other non-interest income. Net interest income rose 4% to SGD 5.69 billion as loans grew 8%. Net interest margin declined nine basis points to 1.74% due to softer average Singapore-dollar interest rates. Fee income rose 9% to SGD 1.99 billion. Higher fees from wealth management, which grew by an underlying 24%, as well as from cards and transaction banking were partially offset by a decline in loan-related fees. Other non-interest income fell 16% to SGD 1.19 billion due to lower trading income and to non-recurring gains a year ago. Expenses rose 1% to SGD 3.77 billion. Underlying headcount fell 1% in tandem with efficiency gains from ongoing digitalisation and cost-management initiatives. The cost-income ratio was at 43%. Profit before allowances was 3% higher at SGD 5.10 billion. Liquidity and capital remain strong Deposits rose 12% from a year ago and 6% from the previous quarter to SGD 362 billion; excluding ANZ, deposits were 8% and 3% higher respectively. The liquidity coverage ratio for the third quarter was 141%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the regulatory requirement due in 2018. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was at 14.0%, declining 0.4 percentage points from the previous quarter as balance sheet growth and the payment of interim dividends more than offset the capital accretion from the third quarter’s earnings. The leverage ratio of 7.5% was more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “The recognition of the residual weak oil and gas support service exposures as NPAs will enable investors to return their focus to our operating performance and digital agenda. Business momentum has been strong as we continued to capture opportunities in a reflationary environment across the markets we operate in. Broad-based loan and fee income growth propelled third-quarter and nine-month total income and profit before allowances to new highs, more than offsetting the impact of less favourable interest rates and trading income. Our digitalisation efforts are progressively transforming the bank, generating customer benefits and creating shareholder returns.” [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

"Reimagining banking, DBS launches world’s largest banking API developer platform",02 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Reimagining_banking_DBS_launches_worlds_largest_banking_API_developer_platform, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today set yet another global milestone with the launch of a banking API developer platform that is the largest by a bank anywhere in the world. The scale of the endeavour at launch underlines DBS’ commitment to reimagining banking for the benefit of customers. For its innovation efforts, last year, DBS was named “World’s Best Digital Bank” by financial publication Euromoney. The API platform will boost the bank’s lead in creating innovative and customer-centric experiences by making available a wide array of APIs for other brands, corporates, fintechs and software developers to plug into. This has the potential to significantly accelerate the bank’s digital ambition and customer impact. With 155 APIs at launch for Singapore across more than 20 categories such as funds transfers, rewards, PayLah! and real-time payments, the platform will offer the world’s largest number of and most relevant banking APIs for companies, whatever their focus, from fintech to lifestyle to build upon. More categories will be added in response to demand. Notable too is that more than 50 companies including household names such as AIG, McDonald’s, MSIG, PropertyGuru, as well as start-ups like Activpass, FoodPanda, Homage, and soCash have already hopped onto the platform to develop solutions that will bring more convenience and value to customers. For example, McDonald’s is the first fast food chain to offer round-the-clock food delivery services. By making use of DBS’ banking APIs under the PayLah! payments category, McDonald’s introduced the convenience of PayLah! to its McDelivery customer base this year, expanding their cashless payment options. A McDonald’s spokesperson said, “We serve more than 1.2 million customers a week in Singapore. The DBS API partnership has helped us to speed up the process of payments so that our customers can focus on enjoying their meals. Speed is essential in this process, and we’re delighted that banks such as DBS are exploring the use of digital capabilities to smoothen such experiences.” Another example is social enterprise Homage, a one-stop, on-demand service that offers in-home caregiving services for seniors to help them maintain their independence, and live with dignity and grace in their old age. By partnering with DBS, Homage’s customers, who are usually family members of the seniors who need care, are now able to instantly redeem their credit card reward points to arrange for a Care Assessment by a professional Homage Nurse and Care Specialist to determine the home care needs and requirements of their loved ones. Gillian Tee, CEO and co-founder, Homage said, “Families who engage Homage want the peace of mind and security that their loved ones are well taken care of. Therefore, it's great to work with DBS to provide our care managers with a painless and hassle-free payment experience as they take the first steps in engaging care, keeping the administrative part of home care in the background and allowing our care to stand out. Families across Singapore can now directly pay for an in-home care assessment and get a custom care plan through their credit card reward points. I’m impressed that they took time to understand Homage’s on-the-ground challenges and were able to work with us to integrate financial relief schemes and payments within our app so that caregivers could have a one-stop-shop to book and pay for the care that their loved ones need.” Customers searching for their dream home on PropertyGuru, Asia’s leading online property group, can also get an instant affordability assessment. Vivek Kumar, Director, Product (Consumer) Technology, PropertyGuru Group said, “In Singapore, PropertyGuru helps more than five million people every month to find a home. We constantly deliver on our mission to empower property seekers to make confident property decisions and are very excited to partner with DBS and launch Singapore’s first home loan affordability check. Property seekers, while browsing for property options, now have real-time access to their home loan affordability making their search process extremely effective.” Shee Tse Koon, Group Head of Strategy and Planning, and Head of Ecosystems, said, “The digital momentum that we see today is just the tip of the iceberg. By creating ecosystem partnerships – collaborating, creating and innovating together with partners – we believe that we can provide the best products, solutions and experiences. Today’s launch is a bold move in the direction of shaping the future of banking, with the customer at the heart of the banking experience.” David Gledhill, Group Chief Information Officer, DBS Bank said, “DBS embarked on a journey to transform our tech infrastructure nine years ago. With that early start, we are now ahead of many others in being digital to the core. This has given us an edge – enabling us to operate with fintech-like agility and nimbleness, and also platform-like inclusiveness. This will be transformative in ways not imagined previously, both for the customer and the bank.” In recent years, DBS has been stepping up collaboration with governments, partners, fintechs, start-ups and other members of the ecosystem to make banking simpler and more seamless for customers through the use of partner APIs. They include DBS digibank in India, a complete bank in a phone, which has acquired 1.6 million customers since its launch in April last year; as well as DBS PayLah!, Singapore’s most popular mobile wallet. The platform, DBS Developers, was officially launched today. Interested parties are invited to register their interest at www.dbs.com/dbsdevelopers where they will be given tools to connect in a development sandbox, enabling them to test their ideas.

DBS launches enhanced DBS Multiplier Account,01 Nov 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_enhanced_DBS_Multiplier_Account, Singapore ,"- To cater to the financial aspirations of young adults in Singapore, DBS has launched the enhanced DBS Multiplier Account, making it easier for them to qualify for higher interest rates on their account balances by lowering the transaction threshold, with no minimum salary crediting amount and no minimum credit card spend. The first-of-its-kind programme was introduced in 2014 to reward customers for consolidating their banking with DBS, with any combination of salary credit, credit card spend, insurance, investments or mortgage instalments. Since its launch, the DBS Multiplier Account has seen an average account growth of 30% year-on-year. To better understand their financial needs and preferences, DBS conducted an extensive year-long customer immersion exercise with close to 1,000 young adults in Singapore. The bank discovered that 64% of young adults felt that managing their finances took up a lot of their time, while 38% felt that it was complicated and a barrier to achieving their financial goals. Other insights indicated that even as young adults want to be rewarded for their regular banking transactions, they prefer not to be tied down by certain conditions – for example, a minimum amount for salary credit or minimum credit card spend. Further research also showed that half of young adults aged 21 to 35 in Singapore spend less than SGD500 on their credit cards monthly. With the enhanced DBS Multiplier Account, young adults need not worry about fulfilling such conditions. To enjoy higher interest rates on their account balances, they only need to have their salaries credited with DBS/POSB and transact in one or more of the following categories: credit card spend, home loan instalment, insurance or investments. To enjoy higher rates, customers just need to have their total eligible monthly transactions add up to SGD2,000 or more: • Between 1.55% p.a. and 2.08% p.a. if their salary credit and transaction in one category add up to SGD2,000 or more • Between 1.8% p.a. and 3.5% p.a. if their salary credit and transactions in two or more categories add up to SGD2,000 or more DBS Multiplier Account interest rates   *Total monthly transactions consist of salary crediting and one or more of these categories: credit card spend, home loan instalment, insurance or investments By lowering the minimum threshold for total eligible transactions from SGD7,500 to SGD2,000, the enhanced DBS Multiplier Account allows more young adults to qualify for higher interest rates, starting from the time they enter the workforce. For example: • A university fresh graduate with a net salary of SGD2,700 and a credit card spend of SGD200 monthly will enjoy interest rates of 1.85% p.a. on his/her DBS Multiplier Account balance • A young working adult who was been in the workforce for a few years with a net salary of SGD4,600 and a credit card spend of SGD450 monthly will earn 1.90% p.a. on his/her DBS Multiplier Account balance • A married young working adult earning a net salary of SGD5,000, with a credit card spend of SGD550 and a home loan instalment of SGD2,600 monthly, will enjoy 2.20% p.a. on his/her DBS Multiplier Account balance  Eligible transactions are detected at customer level – across customers’ various product holdings with DBS/POSB so they only need to deposit their balances in a DBS Multiplier Account, while transacting with their usual DBS/POSB accounts, to enjoy the higher interest rates. Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, said, “DBS has always led the industry in providing customers with innovative and relevant products and services to address their financial needs. When we launched this first-of-its-kind programme back in 2014, we wanted to help our customers maximise their funds and grow their wealth in a smarter way.” He added, “With the enhanced DBS Multiplier Account, more young adults will be able to benefit from the higher interest rates as they take up relevant financial services based on their changing needs. We understand their need for flexibility in how they manage their finances. We also want to be there for them at an early life stage and help them achieve their financial and life goals.” Customers can simply apply for the enhanced DBS Multiplier account at www.dbs.com.sg/multi.

"DBS to proactively re-skill 1,500 employees to equip them with new skills and competencies to be future-ready",31 Oct 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_proactively_re_skill_1500_employees_to_equip_them_with_new_skills_and_competencies_to_be_future_ready, Singapore ,"- In an all-out effort to help its employees obtain the necessary knowledge and competencies to sharpen their competitiveness and deepen their skillset, DBS Bank today announced that it will proactively re-skill 1,500 employees in the next 18 months. These employees will be re-skilled under the bank’s proactive Professional Conversion Programme (DBS PCP). In a first for a Singapore bank, DBS has proactively mapped out eight job roles to help employees in these roles obtain the necessary knowledge and competencies to take on new or enhanced roles within the bank after being re-skilled. The roles identified are from departments across the bank, such as back-end operations in Consumer Banking and Institutional Banking and client-facing ones in branches. For example, a Branch Service Executive whose current job is to serve customers’ banking needs over the counter, can be re-skilled to help the bank raise awareness of its latest self-service options. In another example, a Customer Service Officer (CSO) currently stationed at the Customer Centre could be re-skilled to do more than just answering incoming calls. A CSO’s role can be enhanced to also serve customers through new digital channels such as live chat, video teller machines (VTM), emails and even social media. Nahariah Mohd Nor, now 45 years old, joined DBS for the second time in 2008 [1] . As a Service Executive, her role was to serve customers’ banking needs over the counter at the branch and help them with account opening, cash deposits and withdrawals. This year, after close to nine years as a Service Executive with DBS, Nahariah wanted to try her hand at a new role and specifically requested to do something related to technology and banking. After speaking with her manager, Nahariah underwent six weeks of intense classroom training and started her on-the-job training stint at the DBS Customer Centre as a Customer Service Officer. In this new role, she uses her 20 years of branch banking knowledge to help answer customers’ queries virtually through a VTM. Nahariah said, “The banking industry is changing so fast and I kept reading about all these digital trends in banking. I’m glad that I took the leap to re-skill myself because I now feel more confident to face the future where technology is changing the way customers bank and transact. My new colleagues and supervisors are very supportive and my new role gives me a greater sense of ownership and empowerment. I am always delighted when customers are happy with my service. And I love it when they take selfies with me after I successfully help them through a transaction or query!” Another example is Ratna Manoharan, now 51 years old. Ratna joined DBS in 1985 as a branch employee processing more than a thousand cheques a day. Today as an Assistant Service Manager, she is empowered to take a more proactive role in helping customers with their banking needs. Ratna said, “With the training that DBS has equipped me with, I feel confident when taking on new opportunities and challenges that come with working in the banking industry. With these new skills, what’s most important is that I’m also able to advise customers to make banking simpler and more convenient for them.” To fund the Bank’s proactive Professional Conversion Programme, DBS will receive partial funding from Workforce Singapore (WSG), with the balance of the re-skilling costs borne by the bank. Employees who are on the programme will undergo classroom training ranging from five days to a month and six months of on-the-job training. Lee Yan Hong, Group Head of Human Resources, DBS Bank said: “DBS is committed to building a future-ready workforce that will boost our ability to spearhead the transformation of banking in a fast-changing business environment. With our customers’ banking preferences changing and technology transforming the way financial services are provided and delivered, over the next five years, DBS aims to re-skill our employees to equip them with the relevant skills to stay ahead in a dynamic financial industry.” In recognition of DBS’ commitment to building a future-ready workforce, earlier this month, DBS was recognised by Aon Hewitt as ‘Best Employer in Asia Pacific’ for the second year running. The bank was also the first-ever company to be awarded ‘Best of the Best Employers’ in three countries – Singapore, Indonesia and Taiwan – in the same year. Across the region, DBS was recognised as ‘Best Employer’ in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Taiwan, while DBS Hong Kong, China and Indonesia won special awards for ‘Commitment to Engagement’, ‘Digital HR’ and ‘Best Employer for Women’ respectively. Lee said: “Our employees are the heart of our organisation and we are committed to honing an engaged and empowered employee base. Our key focus is to future-proof our people and equip them with the necessary skills and abilities, to stay ahead of the curve and create better business outcomes for our customers.” DBS is also one of 14 organisations in Singapore to be conferred the inaugural SkillsFuture Employer Award in recognition of the bank’s support for the SkillsFuture movement. The SkillsFuture Employer Award also recognised the bank’s investments in employees’ skills development, which include initiatives such as DBS Academy, DBS SkillsFlex, Internal Professional Conversion Programme and Young Talent Pipeline Programmes.

DBS to help businesses save on foreign exchange costs,17 Oct 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_help_businesses_save_on_foreign_exchange_costs, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced the launch of the DBS Corporate Multi-Currency Account (Corporate MCA) to help businesses transact and manage up to 13 currencies [1] in separate e-wallets all maintained in one single account. The Corporate MCA enables businesses to send and receive cross-border payments in different currencies and manage their foreign exchange costs more efficiently as incoming currencies are stored in respective e-wallets until exchange rates are in the business’ favour [2] . In addition, the Corporate MCA does away with the need to maintain a minimum balance in different currency accounts. Instead, all a business has to do, is to maintain a minimum balance of SGD 10,000 in the account. [3]  According to an International Enterprise Internationalisation Survey [4] conducted in 2016, overseas revenue for companies based in Singapore grew by 4.2 per cent year-on-year, of which 53 per cent of total revenue for Singapore-based SMEs came from overseas. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said, “DBS’ SME customers are constantly thinking about how they can expand their business overseas with greater cost efficiencies. Whether it is paying their suppliers and vendors globally or receiving payments from their customers, we hope that the DBS Corporate MCA will help to alleviate some of the administrative and cost commitments in dealing with foreign currencies This is part of our continuous drive to make banking simpler and more convenient for our customers.” With more businesses making and collecting payments in different currencies, the corporate MCA will especially benefit SMEs who previously did not have access to such multi-currency accounts to manage cross-border payments and transactions. It is also ideal for the growing number of Singapore-based companies with overseas suppliers and vendors as they can save on administration and foreign exchanges costs from DBS’ corporate internet banking platform, DBS IDEAL. Tat Hui Foods Pte Ltd, a leading manufacturer of the popular KOKA Noodles which exports their products to over 40 countries, is one example. Mr. James Lim, Executive Director of Tat Hui Foods said, “The DBS Corporate MCA has helped Tat Hui Foods save on foreign exchange costs when receiving funds in foreign currencies as incoming currencies are stored in separate e-wallets until exchange rates are in our favour. With one multi-currency account to maintain, it is easier and more efficient to send and receive money in a few different currencies.

"Top entrepreneurs of 2017 SVC Asia set to make social impact targeting educational, healthcare, agricultural and environmental sectors",04 Oct 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Top_entrepreneurs_of_2017_SVC_Asia_set_to_make_social_impact_targeting_educational_healthcare_agricultural_and_environmental_sectors," Singapore, Regional ","- Eight teams took home a total of S$180,000 in cash prizes from the 2017 DBS-NUS Social Venture Challenge Asia (SVC Asia) - the highest amount ever presented within the competition’s four-year history. SVC Asia is an Asia-wide competition for social enterprises. It identifies and supports innovative ideas and social ventures that demonstrate positive, scalable and sustainable social impact within the region. Organised jointly by NUS Enterprise, the entrepreneurial arm of the National University of Singapore (NUS), and DBS Foundation, SVC Asia provides multi-dimensional support for social entrepreneurs through its learning platform, access to networks and mentorship assistance. This year, SVC Asia brought in several corporate partners to provide additional experience, networks, mentorship support and resources for the competition. Besides the support from existing corporate partner, Syngenta, new partners included Dell and The HEAD Foundation, which provided sponsorship for additional cash prizes, while Experian provided business intelligence reports and insights. The winning teams of the 2017 SVC Asia are divided into several categories: SVC Asia Enterprise Category  Six teams took home cash prizes of S$20,000 each from DBS Foundation. This category was applicable for social ventures that are already generating revenues and seeking to scale their operations and impact. The teams are (in alphabetical order): ANA by Karma (Hong Kong) – This social enterprise empowers Bhutanese women to achieve financial independence by utilising their talents to create artisanal hand-woven products. ANA by Karma also provides development programmes for their weavers and children, teaching business skills, financial literacy and basic computer skills. Crowde (Indonesia) - Crowde is a crowd-investing web platform that connects small-scale farmers with retail investors, helping them raise working capital for their agriculture projects. In Indonesia, such farmers may find it difficult to get a traditional bank loan, as many live near or below the poverty line. The socially-responsible investors also benefit through a win-win profit sharing scheme. Haqdarshak Empowerment Solutions (India) – Haqdarshak helps citizens in India to discover and apply for government and non-government financial schemes. As many of such schemes can be confusing, especially for illiterate, rural citizens, Haqdarshak uses a combination of AI technology and community entrepreneurs to deliver its service. HelpUsGreen (India) – Every year, 80,000 tonnes of waste flowers are dumped into the Ganges river, with pesticides and insecticides from the flowers polluting the water. HelpUsGreen addresses this problem through ‘flowercycling®’, where floral waste is collected and handcrafted into organic fertiliser, natural incense and a biodegradable alternative to plastic. In addition to making environmental impact, this provides employment to rural women who process the floral waste. HelpUsGreen also received the ‘Judges’ Choice Award’, for its potential sustainable and scalable social impact. Imagtor (Vietnam) - This social enterprise helps people with disabilities to have a successful career, by equipping them with employable skill sets and providing work opportunities. Upon graduating, the majority of Imagtor’s students are offered jobs, where they provide quality digital services such as video and photography editing. TEMU (Indonesia) - 90 per cent of Indonesia’s workforce are low-skilled workers, with more than 38 million people living below the poverty line. TEMU aims to break this cycle of poverty through its mobile and web application that collects data from employers and matches it with individuals with the right skill sets. Amongst the six winners, HelpUsGreen stood out in particular and received the ‘Judges Choice Award’, as the judging panel was particularly touched by its founder’s passion and its triple bottom-line business. SVC Asia Idea Category Two teams received cash prizes of S$5,000 each from DBS Foundation. This category was applicable for teams that are still validating their idea, trying to build a minimum viable product or conducting trials to test their concept. The winning teams are: Evoware (Indonesia) – Indonesia is the second largest contributor of plastic waste in the world, with as much as 90 per cent of plastic waste being dumped into the ocean. Social enterprise Evoware aims to address this problem through developing edible, biodegradable and eco-friendly bioplastics. This is made from sustainably-produced seaweed, meaning the positive social impact is not only on the environment but also providing livelihood for seaweed farmers. As Evoware says – Eat your cup, save the earth! CocoAsenso (The Philippines) – CocoAsenso is establishing a network of efficient, small-scale coconut processing facilities in remote regions in the Philippines, with the first facility in Samar to be set up by end of 2017. Coconuts are purchased directly from local farmers at fair prices. Farmers are also offered training/financing to improve crop production and employment in the processing facility. CocoAsenso products include virgin coconut oil, coconut jerky and desiccated coconut. In addition, SVC Asia corporate partners sponsored cash prizes, as follows: Syngenta Agriculture Social Enterprise Award  A cash prize of S$20,000 sponsored by Syngenta was awarded to the best agriculture-related social enterprise that demonstrated the most innovative business solution and positive, sustainable social impact. The winning team is Crowde (Indonesia). See description of Crowde under the Enterprise category. The HEAD Foundation Innovative Social Enterprise Award (Education)  A cash prize of S$20,000 sponsored by The HEAD Foundation was awarded to the social enterprise team with the best proposed use of technology and innovation for education. The winning team is Imagtor (Vietnam). See description of Imagtor under the Enterprise category. Dell Digital Award Two cash prizes of S$5,000 each sponsored by Dell were awarded to social enterprise teams that demonstrated the best use of digital technologies to make positive social impact. In addition to cash prizes for the two winning teams, Dell’s senior executives will be investing their time in mentoring them over the course of six months, to help them realise their ambitions through digital technology. The winning teams have demonstrated solutions with high societal impact that can be accelerated with the use of technology: Imagtor (Vietnam) – See description of Imagtor under the Enterprise category. Imagtor’s digital project aims to expand its connected workplace (home office and partner network) with an upgraded IT infrastructure and software. TEMU (Indonesia) – See description of TEMU under the Enterprise category. TEMU’s digital project aims to further improve its application in areas such as security and automation. Dell also presented laptops to the top 16 SVC Asia teams, which included the Dell XPS 13 and Latitude 5280. Asia For Good Reader’s Choice Award SLCO Community Resources (Hong Kong), which provides a bilingual language development programme for parents and children who are both deaf and hearing, won the Asia For Good Reader’s Choice Award, based on the highest number of votes by Asia For Good readers. The team will receive a full-length feature to be published on the Asia For Good website, which will be promoted on social media. “This is the fourth year we have organised SVC Asia, and I am pleased to see the calibre of the teams and their business ideas improving every year. We are also heartened to see more corporations partnering with us this year to further enhance follow-on support and help to the finalist teams,” said Professor Wong Poh Kam, Director, NUS Entrepreneurship Centre, who also chaired the final judging panel for SVC Asia 2017. Said Karen Ngui, Head of DBS Group Strategic Marketing & Communications and Board Member of the DBS Foundation, “SVC Asia has come a long way since its inception in 2014 and we are delighted to see the platform extending its reach further every year. We are committed to developing the ecosystem in Asia for innovative social enterprises by providing mentorship, networking, access to marketplace and impact funding. This year, to provide even greater and more customised support to both early-stage and growth-stage social ventures, we introduced two separate submission categories and received a record number of applications.” SVC Asia 2017 was held from April to October 2017. Over 1000 entries from nearly 30 countries across Asia took part. Participants could access online resources and attend local workshops held in Singapore, China, Indonesia and Taiwan. The top 16 teams were flown to Singapore in early October 2017 for coaching, mentoring and judging. The panel of judges made their decision based on the strength of the teams’ value proposition, social impact, market potential and economic/ financial model. In August this year, SVC Asia was awarded the “Best Flagship Initiative” for the Sustainable Business Awards (SBA) 2017, organised by Global Initiatives in partnership with PwC Singapore.

DBS launches world’s first online simulation tool to help CFOs and Corporate Treasurers design and derive optimised cash management solutions | 繁體,04 Oct 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_worlds_first_online_simulation_tool_to_help_CFOs_and_Corporate_Treasurers_design_and_derive_optimised_cash_management_solutions," Singapore, Hong Kong ","- DBS Bank, Asia’s leading digital bank, today announced the launch of the world’s first online treasury and cash management simulation tool for CFOs and corporate treasurers. Users are able to simulate various bank and corporate solutions on DBS Treasury Prism ( treasuryprism.dbs.com ) at no cost, and review potential opportunities that will maximise value for their enterprise.  CFOs and corporate treasurers often manage several accounts with different currencies and transaction flows across multiple countries. As a result, they often engage a few different banks to help create an optimal treasury and cash management solution. The process in doing so, called a Request for Proposal, is often time-consuming, unproductive and tedious.  Using a human-centred design approach, DBS uncovered five critical areas to address through in-depth interviews with over 50 CFOs, corporate treasurers and finance professionals. These problems include: - Too much preparatory work to achieve an optimal solution - Difficulty in monetising or quantifying the benefits and costs of solutions proposed by different banks - No time to keep up with the latest regulatory, tax and market changes - Too much effort to work with stakeholders on a new cash management solution - Difficulty in implementing new and complex solutions  DBS Treasury Prism was custom-built to address these challenges by giving CFOs and corporate treasurers the ability to independently experiment with cash and liquidity management structures and analyse the relative benefits and costs. The bank-agnostic platform takes into account the regulatory and tax environment in the markets where the company operates in, and offers immediate and contextual insights to help them understand the implications that each solution has on the business.  Users can create simulations of account and liquidity structures across multiple markets and compare each solution through a quantified assessment of its cost and benefits. The combination of digital solutioning and contextual insights results in a value-rich experience for treasurers as they explore potential opportunities and solutions.  John Laurens, DBS’ Head of Global Transaction Services said, “CFOs and corporate treasurers increasingly come to DBS for digital advisory services and to co-create digital business solutions with their financial and commercial operations. The nature of these digital engagements have elevated the partnership between transaction bankers and treasury and finance professionals well beyond the conventional bank-customer interaction. DBS Treasury Prism is a product of innovation and customer-centred digital engagement. Finance and treasury professionals have therefore shaped the platform through ideation, development and beta testing stages and will continue to drive the agile development of DBS Treasury Prism.”  Some of the key features of DBS Treasury Prism include:  Building simulations and quantifying benefits Treasurers often receive multiple cash management proposals from banks; determining the best solution is challenging as the benefits are not always clearly evident. DBS Treasury Prism empowers treasurers by enabling them to simulate various structures for a range of international currencies, taking into account the tax and regulatory implications in over 20 markets including key financial centres in Asia, Europe and the US. Each simulation features an Optimisation Score derived from a smart algorithm that takes into account the interest yield and debt, tax, bank fees and corporate costs, helping users quantify the benefits of each structure.  The dynamic online platform is equipped with over 30 liquidity and transactional flow management tools, including bank solutions and corporate tools such as interest optimisation, notional pooling, instant payments, and payments and receivables management, all supported by real time insights. In addition, the platform has an 'Optimise' feature that recommends alternative structures for users to explore and consider.  Access to contextual insights in real time  Keeping up-to-date with the latest changes in regulations and tax is time-consuming and challenging. The platform solves this problem by pulling current tax and regulation updates in over 20 markets globally, providing users with contextual insights in real time as they create simulations. DBS Treasury Prism also features a Knowledge Centre with articles on emerging trends, new solutions and the latest market practices in treasury and cash management, giving treasurers a full breadth of information.  “What takes a week today can be done in two minutes with Treasury Prism. This is the most innovative solution for corporate treasury I’ve seen this year.” - Goh Seng Ti, General Manager (Treasury & Accounting), Isuzu Motors Asia  ""It’s the first time I see a bank making such a system for their clients. It's very comprehensive. With the search function, knowledge centre, glossary – it really covers all that a corporate treasurer needs in such a tool. We can also use it to educate our internal and external stakeholders on cash management, saving time for us."" - Henry Ma, Regional Treasurer, Emerson Electric Asia-Pacific  “Managing money across the Asia region is not easy due to regulations – this platform makes it easy to see what’s possible, with regulatory insights, through a drag and drop interface. It’s something not readily available in other Treasury platforms.” - Group Treasurer, Kerry Logistics  Building the global transaction services business is one of the bank’s strategic priorities, and today, it constitutes 31% of the bank’s institutional banking business income. In particular, cash management services have grown from strength to strength. DBS was also named Best Transaction Bank, Asia by The Asset, and Best Overall Bank for Cash Management, Asia Pacific by Global Finance earlier this year.

DBS is first Asian bank and first Singapore company to join global renewable energy initiative RE100,13 Sep 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_is_first_Asian_bank_and_first_Singapore_company_to_join_global_renewable_energy_initiative_RE100, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced that it will join RE100, a global renewable energy campaign led by The Climate Group in partnership with CDP, that brings together influential global businesses committed to using 100% renewable energy to power their operations. This makes DBS the first Asian bank as well as first company in Singapore to be one of more than 100 international companies to make the ‘go 100% renewable’ commitment. The announcement comes just days ahead of Climate Week NYC 2017, a key international summit that gathers global business and government leaders to debate and discuss climate change solutions. In line with the commitment, DBS has set a target to power 100% of its operations in Singapore using renewable energy by 2030, and eventually aims to extend this to 100% of its global operations. This will be achieved through the installation of solar panels at its office building in Changi Business Park, and the procurement of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from solar energy companies in Singapore. The bank also plans to work closely with The Climate Group and CDP to draw up similar renewable energy roadmaps for its regional operations. This initiative is spearheaded by the bank’s Sustainability Council and is aligned with two of the four UN Sustainable Development Goals that the bank has adopted, namely “Affordable and Clean Energy” (SDG7) and “Climate Action” (SDG13). The RE100 commitment reinforces the bank’s continued efforts to combat global warming and climate change by reducing its own environmental footprint. Mike Power, Co-Chair of DBS’ Sustainability Council said: “Joining RE100 underscores DBS’ intent to contribute, as a responsible corporate citizen, towards the long-term sustainability of our planet. Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing everyone today and tackling it means it’s essential that we dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Transitioning towards a low-carbon economy powered by 100% renewable energy is both technically feasible and economically viable. As Southeast Asia’s largest bank, DBS recognises the leadership role it can play in this transition and we believe that ensuring our own operations across the region are powered from 100% renewable sources makes sense, and besides, it’s the right thing to do.” Helen Clarkson, CEO, The Climate Group, said: “It’s fantastic to have one of Asia’s largest banks join RE100 just ahead of Climate Week NYC – it sends a timely message to the market that business backs renewable energy. DBS Bank is just starting out on their journey to 100% renewable power, so we look forward to following their progress globally over the coming years. Corporate leadership on energy and climate change is key to delivering on the Paris Agreement at speed, and I look forward to many other companies following suit.” The RE100 commitment marks another milestone in DBS’ sustainability journey, which has gained momentum in recent years. DBS’ Sustainability Council was established in February this year with an ambit to develop DBS’ overarching sustainability framework and drive sustainability initiatives across the bank. Last month, DBS became the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index, comprising more than 800 global companies who have demonstrated good ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) practices. DBS was also the first bank in Singapore to issue a green bond to support the financing of green assets. DBS’ main office buildings and 20 branches in Singapore have been awarded BCA Green Mark Awards by the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore, in recognition of the energy efficiency measures implemented at these premises. The bank was also among the first in the banking sector in Singapore to achieve the BCA Green Mark for retail certification, with two branches achieving higher certification of Gold Plus Green Mark Awards.

Corporates and SMEs can now track their cross-border payments with DBS' new service | 繁體,12 Sep 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Corporates_and_SMEs_can_now_track_their_cross_border_payments_with_DBS_new_service," Singapore, Hong Kong, Regional ","- Corporates and SMEs in Singapore and Hong Kong can now track their cross-border payments via DBS, leveraging SWIFT Global Payments Innovation (gpi). DBS is the first bank in Singapore and Hong Kong to execute cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking in these two markets, helping corporates and SMEs become more efficient in their cash management.  In the past, corporates and SMEs have struggled to track their cross-border payments as these transactions are routed through multiple banks, with different processing times. Customers can now find out the status of their cross-border payments in real-time, such as whether funds have been received by the beneficiary or whether the funds are still being processed. They will be able to know the amount being credited into the beneficiary account, foreign exchange rate applied and even time taken for funds to be credited. The tracking on SWIFT gpi is based on a Unique End-to-end Transaction Reference number (UETR) assigned by the originating bank. This UETR enables real-time tracking of the status of the cross-border payment. In addition, customers can expect a faster turnaround time for their cross-border payments as banks using SWIFT gpi are governed by service-level agreements and are required to process transactions within four hours. Navinder Duggal, Group Head of Cash Product Management, DBS Bank said: “The banking industry has achieved a major milestone with SWIFT gpi going live. DBS, being an early adopter of SWIFT gpi in Asia, sees gpi as an important step towards improving the customer experience for cross-border payments. We are pleased to make banking more expedient for our corporate and SME customers.” Reactions from corporates have been positive. HTL International, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of leather sofas and leather upholstery hides with a presence in over 52 countries, makes cross-border payments on a daily basis. With this new service, HTL International is now able to make these payments faster and track them. Serene Wong, Treasury Manager, HTL International said: “SWIFT gpi is a powerful capability which enables us to know where our remittances are across different banks across the globe. This provides transparency and visibility to our cross-border payments. We are looking forward to more banks quickly joining SWIFT gpi, so that we can then track all our TT payments using the power of gpi. We bank with partners like DBS, which are at the forefront of innovation, to meet our cash management requirements.” Eddie Haddad, Managing Director of SWIFT Asia Pacific said: “SWIFT gpi is the biggest thing to happen to correspondent banking in 30 years; since its go-live, the global financial industry has been fully committed and service adoption is growing fast. In collaboration with DBS and other members of our community, SWIFT gpi solves the inherent process challenges in cross-border payments today and this will prove to be a new world for corporates.” [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS receives approval to establish wholly-owned local subsidiary in India,04 Sep 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_receives_approval_to_establish_wholly_owned_local_subsidiary_in_India," Singapore, India ","- DBS Bank India (DBS India), part of Asia’s leading financial services group DBS Group Holdings, announced today that it received in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to convert its existing India franchise to a locally incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) in India. Through WOS, DBS will leverage its overall strengths and resources, along with its experience in India, to build a scalable business through a multi-channel strategy. This will include a combination of digital and physical formats to allow the bank to cater to the requirements of convenience and presence by its target customer segments. DBS will be able to bring its product innovation and technology-led delivery model from across Asia to serve retail, small and medium enterprise (SME) and large corporates across a larger footprint. Underlining its commitment to India, and as part of its ongoing journey to shape the future of banking, DBS also inaugurated its new India headquarters at the iconic Express Towers in Nariman Point, Mumbai, today.  Spread across 100,000 square feet over five floors in Express Towers, the agile set-up, with activity-based workspaces and social zones, is designed to facilitate greater interaction and ideation among employees, so that they can reimagine the customer journey and turn banking into a joyful experience. The new office is unique for a bank as it features open, collaborative workspaces that reflects DBS’ push to embed a start-up culture within the bank.  This latest investment follows a number of strategic initiatives that DBS rolled out in India over the past few years. In April 2016, it launched digibank, India’s first mobile-only bank, and has acquired around 1.5 million customers to date. In October 2016, the bank integrated its e-banking solution with India’s leading enterprise resource planning software, saving SME and corporate customers considerable time and effort. The innovative connected banking experience has enabled thousands of SME customers to seamlessly and conveniently make goods and services tax payments directly within the ERP platform. To strengthen its technological capabilities in the region, as well as support its digital banking strategy, DBS also established DBS Asia Hub 2, its largest technology hub outside Singapore, in Hyderabad last year. WOS, an enabler for DBS India to expand operations  DBS was the first Singapore bank to set up a representative office in India in 1994, upgrading it to a formal bank branch in 1995. DBS is currently the largest Singapore bank in India and the country’s fifth-largest foreign bank by assets. DBS India will look to deepen its relationship with large corporates by offering financing solutions across their entire value chain. While the bank will continue to actively leverage its Asia-wide connectivity to drive profitable growth through cross-border banking solutions, WOS will enable the bank to offer competitive transaction banking and supply chain solutions through specialised offerings that span both cash management and trade finance. Said DBS India CEO Surojit Shome: “DBS is pleased to receive RBI’s in-principle approval to convert its India franchise to a wholly-owned subsidiary. The approval enables us to accelerate our growth plans, significantly expand our operations and build a wider footprint. As a WOS, DBS India will be able to better serve its customers, particularly SMEs, in support of the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.” Said DBS Group CEO Piyush Gupta: “DBS has been present in India for over 20 years. Over this time, we have grown to become the fifth-largest foreign bank in India. As we look into the future, I believe India’s consumption boom, investment and export drive, as well as positive policy action, will further fuel its growth, making it one of the biggest stories in Asia by 2030. With this local incorporation, DBS will be able to build greater scale in India, enabling us to better participate in India’s rise.”  [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

"DBS launches digibank, an entire bank in the phone, in Indonesia",29 Aug 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_digibank_an_entire_bank_in_the_phone_in_Indonesia," Singapore, Regional, Indonesia ","- DBS Bank, a leading bank in Asia, today officially unveiled digibank by DBS (digibank), a groundbreaking mobile-led bank, in Indonesia. A revolutionary offering, digibank is paperless and signatureless, and brings together an entire suite of innovative technology – from biometrics to artificial intelligence (AI) – to enable customers to enjoy a whole new way of banking. The Iaunch follows the successful rollout of digibank in India in April last year, which has enabled DBS to penetrate India’s retail banking market with about 1.5 million new customers acquired to date. Indonesia’s Minister of Communication and Information Technology Rudiantara congratulated DBS on its innovations at the digibank launch. He also said that the government foresees that Indonesia’s digital economy will reach USD 130 billion, or about 12% of Indonesia's GDP, in 2020. With Indonesia's economy shifting from a commodity-led to service-based one, this will encourage the rise of the digital economy in the country. According to the Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia (APJII) survey, Internet users in Indonesia make up 132.7 million or 51.8% of the total population. The We Are Social survey has found that around 91% of Indonesian citizens have a mobile phone and 47% of them own smartphones. Along with the growing Internet penetration, Indonesia Financial Authority Services (OJK) said that the number of customers using e-banking has increased from 13.6 million customers in 2012 to 54 million customers in 2016. The frequency of Internet banking transactions has also increased, from 150.8 million transactions in 2012 to 406.6 million transactions in 2016. Said DBS Indonesia President Director Paulus Sutisna: “Over the past few years, Indonesia has seen a rapid growth in the number of Internet and smartphone users. Along with this, we’ve witnessed a change in customer behaviour and people increasingly want a simple, fast and effortless way to bank. As a bank that is committed to shaping the future of banking, we’re excited to introduce digibank in Indonesia, giving customers the ability to bank anytime, anywhere.” With digibank Indonesia, customer will experience a seamless banking journey with these groundbreaking features: • Biometric technology. Indonesia citizens who live in the Greater Jakarta area (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) can open a digibank account anywhere at a time of their choosing. All they have to do is arrange to meet a digibank agent, who will assist them to do so using a biometric device on the spot. There is no paperwork involved. DBS has made this possible by leveraging E-KTP, Indonesia’s biometrics-enabled ID programme. • Customer service provided by a 24x7 Artificial Intelligence-driven Virtual Assistant. Customers will be able to converse with digibank’s AI-powered virtual assistant to get their queries answered. They can simply type or say “What is my account balance?” or “Please show me my five latest transactions”, and the Virtual Assistant will assist. This is akin to having a banker at one’s beck and call, without having to speak to a call centre agent. • An intelligent financial planning and monitoring feature that helps customers be smarter about their money. People often lose track of their spending, especially during festive months, birthdays, graduations, and other occasions. With the digibank Spending Tracker feature, customers can easily plan their expenses while simultaneously monitoring their banking transactions made using their digibank debit card. In-built into digibank is a budget optimiser that helps customers do their budgeting, track expenses and analyse purchasing trends. • Security that is enhanced through dynamic inbuilt security. Most banks’ customers are used to receiving One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via SMS, and then typing codes into pages to authorise their mobile banking transactions. Digibank has an embedded soft token security, avoiding the need to wait for SMSs to arrive and providing even stronger security for transaction authorisation. Soft token is a dynamic inbuilt security which is safer than OTP. Not only does digibank provide hassle-free banking, its more efficient cost structure compared to brick-and-mortar banking allows it to offer better client value: • 3% interest can be enjoyed by digibank customers from their first rupiah. Customers can open an account with no minimum balance and enjoy 3% interest. • Easy transfer of funds to any bank and ATM cash withdrawal at no cost. Customers can transfer funds up to 200 million rupiah per transaction and up to 500 million rupiah per day, as well as make cash withdrawals from any ATM (ALTO and ATM Bersama) without any administration fees. • Account-holders earn up to 6.25% on deposits. Customers have plenty of flexibility with digibank. Starting with only five million rupiah of deposits, they can earn up to 6.25% interest. Digibank customers also benefit from the regional connectivity that DBS offers. This includes the ability to make cash withdrawals in Singapore at any DBS and POSB ATM, without any fees. The ATM menu for these clients is in Bahasa. Digibank customers also get to enjoy promotion programmes in Singapore with their digibank debit card. Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “A few years ago, we would not have imagined that it would be possible to launch an entire bank in a mobile phone. With digibank, we’ve built a bank that pulls together the power of biometrics, natural language, artificial intelligence and in-built security in one offering. We believe this mobile-led offering represents the future of banking, and are excited to introduce this in Indonesia, a core market for us in Asia.” Digibank by DBS is now available for download on AppStore or GooglePlay, with more information available at www.dbsdigibank.co.id  DBS’ efforts to be at the forefront of banking innovation have been widely recognised. Last year, the bank was recognised as “World’s Best Digital Bank” by Euromoney, Best in the World for Digital Distribution by Efma Accenture and “Best Retail Bank in Asia-Pacific” by The Asian Banker.

The financial sector is an integral part of Singapore’s ambition to be a Smart Nation. DBS’ programme supports the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s vision to create a Smart Financial Centre where technology is used pervasively in the financial industry to increase efficiency, create opportunities, better manage risks, and improve lives. The DBS programme is designed to encourage large-scale participation and digital adoption by all bank employees, and comprises several aspects: • Artificial intelligence-powered e-learning, which can be accessed 24/7 • Experiential learning, such as intrapreneur programmes and hackathons • Grants and scholarships • Innovative learning spaces Lee Yan Hong, Group Head of Human Resources, DBS Bank said: “As the financial sector evolves, the profile of jobs will change and we are committed to helping our people adapt and embrace digital transformation through innovative and immersive continuous learning programmes. An agile and innovative workforce will also make Singapore’s Smart Nation ambition a reality and along with this, we are making significant investments to groom a generation of digital bankers, strengthening Singapore’s talent pool.” Artificial intelligence-powered e-learning  DBS has launched a new cloud-based learning management system called DBS Horizon, which is powered by Saba, a leading cloud-based learning management solution used by leading organisations worldwide. DBS Horizon uses artificial intelligence to make personalised course recommendations, and help employees collaborate, create communities of interest, and engage in mobile education anytime, anywhere across the bank. The user-intuitive interface enables DBS staff to easily search for courses to support their career aspirations and passions. To prepare employees for the future, a new digital curriculum was specially designed and curated to help them learn about digital disruption and transformation via blended learning solutions, a combination of bite-sized e-learning modules and classroom sessions. Topics covered include understanding the digital business model, adopting agile methodologies, journey thinking and how to use technology as business enablers. Experiential learning  DBS employees are given the opportunity to go on paid sabbaticals to work on prototypes and start their own businesses. The bank also runs accelerator programmes which provide mentorship and funding to help these intrapreneurs grow their concepts into prototypes. By giving employees the opportunity to try their hands on building a business from scratch, DBS people learn to think like digital natives. In addition, more than 2,000 DBS staff have participated in human centred design workshops and hackathons, and conducted more than 1,000 experiments since 2015.

POSB Smart Buddy - World’s first in-school wearable tech savings & payments programme launches in 19 schools,16 Aug 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Worlds_first_in_school_wearable_tech_savings_and_payments_programme_POSB_Smart_Buddy_launches_in_19_schools, Singapore ,"- POSB today celebrates the official launch of a global first – the POSB Smart Buddy programme / 储蓄银行智能伙伴计划 – in 19 primary schools. The ground-breaking programme uses wearable tech (a free watch) to teach students how to save and spend wisely by helping them track their savings and spending habits digitally. Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung officiated at the launch event, which was held at Admiralty Primary School. Since the programme’s pilot a year ago, some 6,000 free POSB Smart Buddy watches have been issued to students, with 2,000 watches issued in the last two months alone. The watch helps children take an early step towards digital payments and also monitors their activity levels. Parents can in turn remotely pre-set their child’s daily allowance, send them emergency money, and monitor their kids’ spending, savings, eating habits and activity levels – all with an accompanying app. The programme is optional and parents can choose whether they wish for their children to participate in the programme. The programme further creates a digital payments ecosystem within the school where the school’s canteens and bookstores are set up with digital payment terminals. Students can simply tap and pay with their free POSB Smart Buddy watches. Kiosks are also set up on school grounds, allowing students to scan their watches so they can instantly check on their remaining allowance for the day. The POSB Smart Buddy programme is fully subsidised by POSB, and is opt-in only - parents decide whether they wish for their kids to participate in the programme. (See Appendix for further details) Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank / 星展银行新加坡消费银行部董事总经理兼主管苏孝进, “We believe that POSB Smart Buddy represents a paradigm shift for Singapore’s education sector – not only by changing the way students save and spend – but by creating a digital payment ecosystem within schools. It transforms the age-old ‘pocket money’ tradition, teaches students how to manage their expenses and save wisely, and provides small business owners in schools greater incentive to adopt digital payments. To truly become a Smart Nation and for us to fully embrace digital payments, we aim to educate the students of today so that they are well prepared for the technology of tomorrow.” An updated take on the iconic POSB National Schools Savings Campaign, the POSB Smart Buddy programme is designed to engage a new generation of digitally-savvy kids, encouraging them to cultivate a sensible savings habit in an interactive, engaging manner. Benefits include: Teaching students how to save and manage expenses : Daily transactions are tracked on the POSB Smart Buddy app (with a three-month transaction history provided), so students can monitor their savings and spending patterns over time. Students can create their own savings goals on the app, with completed goals recorded as badges. They can also buy digital Smiley Stamps at 50 cents each at their school bookstore to complete their digital stamp savings card. Once the card is complete, the savings will be automatically transferred to their POSBkids savings account. Finally, students can also use the watch to pay for purchases at all merchants with NETS contactless terminals, such as POPULAR bookstores. Greater convenience for parents, coupled with security : Parents can link their savings account with the POSB Smart Buddy app and effectively manage their child’s spending by setting a daily allowance limit. They can also view their child’s purchases in real-time, and increase the daily allowance limit remotely for emergency spending money. Accumulated savings can be automatically transferred into their child’s POSBkids account. If the child loses their watch, parents can remotely disable the devices in an instant. Fitness and health tracking : The free POSB Smart Buddy watch also doubles as a fitness tracker and can track students’ daily steps, distance travelled, and calories burnt. Parents can in turn check in their child’s fitness using the app. Financial assistance scheme (FAS) support : Working with schools, the programme automatically credits students on FAS with their subsidies and allowances – replacing the usual coupons or vouchers. Support is therefore provided discreetly to needy students. (Upcoming features) Location tracker and biometric feature : The programme may soon feature an in-school locator, which allows parents to track their child’s location within the school compound (canteen, library, classroom, etc.), and a school bus locator where parents can track the real-time location of the bus and be notified when their child boards or alights from the school bus. Both features are currently in the testing phase. Plans are also underway to introduce a biometric payment solution, to provide an even simpler payment journey. POSB worked with a number of local fintechs, including Touché, STYL and 3radical for the POSB Smart Buddy programme. Touché provides the biometrics payment solutions, while POSB works with STYL to provide the payments terminals for the in-school payment infrastructure, the wearable, the FAS (Financial Assistance Scheme) disbursement solution, and the upcoming location tracking capability. Feedback from students and parents who took part in the pilot programme was roundly positive, with most expressing interest in continuing participation. Among the highlights cited by parents were the ability to increase the daily allowance limit of their child in case of emergency, and to monitor their child’s spending and savings in real-time. Going forward, DBS/POSB plans to develop a similar programme tailored for secondary schools and tertiary institutions. Schools or parents who wish to find out more about the POSB Smart Buddy programme can visit www.posb.com.sg/smartbuddy or email posbsmartbuddy@dbs.com. APPENDIX How does the POSB Smart Buddy programme work? Additional quotes School staff Mdm Tan Pin Pin / 陈屏冰, Vice-Principal, Admiralty Primary School, “We hear the call of our Prime Minister to see more advances in cashless payments. Pocket money from parents to children are beginning to go cashless; for example in Denmark. Money is less visible than ever. Developers say financial education is an important objective of the digitisation of parent-to-child pocket money. We think so too. We need to teach kids about invisible money in a cashless society and with the programme, we can prepare them early.” Student Chong Xin Yue / 荘欣月, Student of Admiralty Primary School (Aged 10), “I like using the POSB Smart Buddy steps tracker because I can always compete with my friends and my brother to find out who has the most steps and it also encourages us to exercise more.” Parent Ms. Nurejah, Mother of student at Admiralty Primary School, “POSB Smart Buddy is hassle free, and makes life as parents convenient. I am in control of the situation as I’m able to monitor what he’s spending on, and am able to immediately give him additional allowance when required.” School canteen vendor Woon Aye Loo / 温爱如, School canteen vendor, “The POSB Smart Buddy system makes the queue shorter giving them more time to eat during recess. For myself, I find it very convenient as I no longer have to carry the heavy coins as my daily sales are automatically transferred to my account the very next day.” [End] About POSB A part of the DBS Group, POSB is the largest and oldest local bank in Singapore with over 4 million customers.

DBS partners sgCarMart and Carro to create Singapore’s largest direct buyer-to-seller car marketplace,10 Aug 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_sgCarMart_and_Carro_to_create_Singapores_largest_direct_buyer_to_seller_car_marketplace, Singapore ,"- DBS today announced the official launch of DBS Car Marketplace (go.dbs.com/car) – Singapore's largest direct seller-to-buyer car marketplace, in partnership with sgCarMart and Carro. With some 3,500 direct-owner car listings, DBS Car Marketplace’s official launch makes it Singapore’s first online consumer marketplace helmed by a bank. This follows the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) announcement in June this year proposing to allow banks to operate digital platforms that match buyers and sellers of consumer goods or services. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking (Singapore) / 星展银行新加坡消费银行部董事总经理兼主管苏孝进, “DBS Car Marketplace exemplifies how we are reimagining banking, using digital technology and innovation to extend our reach. Our insights indicate that consumers increasingly value transparency and simplicity, particularly in large purchases such as cars. We’ve therefore designed the marketplace so buyers and sellers are seamlessly guided throughout their purchase or sales journey – from start till completion – and provided relevant financial and product information. DBS Car Marketplace provides a one-stop solution for those looking to purchase or sell cars: it connects buyers and sellers together at a marketplace that contains the largest number of direct-owner car listings, and ensures that they have full control and transparency over every stage of the process.” DBS Car Marketplace also provides several exclusive benefits for buyers and sellers (see Appendix for more information). Sellers can list on both sgCarMart and Carro at one go for free (listing fees are waived till 4 October 2017). Buyers will enjoy DBS’ competitive interest rate of 1.99% p.a. (EIR 3.77% p.a. over a 7-year loan) on their DBS car loan when they buy a car through the DBS Car Marketplace, till 31 August 2017. An on-site car budget calculator provides the estimated loan amount the buyer is eligible for, and then serves them a list of cars based on their budget. If they find a car they are interested in, they can arrange for a test drive online with the seller directly. Finally, both buyers and sellers will be fully guided and enjoy free paperwork services for car ownership transfers. Said Vincent Tan, General Manager of sgCarMart / sgCarMart总经理陈文杰, “End consumers are smarter and more technologically savvy now, which means more of them are choosing to deal with buying or selling their cars themselves. The number of direct owners trying to sell their car on sgCarMart has been steadily increasing by at least 10% every year. We see a huge opportunity to tap into this growing market given this trend, and help speed the growth along. Listings on DBS Car Marketplace will also be visible to the 2.6 million visitors that visit sgCarMart each month until the car is sold. In 2016, 79% of all direct owner car transactions were completed on sgCarMart.” Said Aaron Tan, CEO of Carro / Carro总裁陈伟程, “There is definitely an increased interest and awareness for direct owners to transact between themselves, and we have seen our listings double over the past year and transactions through our platform have been steadily increasing. We believe that the trend to democratise the buying and selling of vehicles will continue and will become the preferred choice for consumers looking to get better returns and more assurance for their sale and purchases.” DBS Car Marketplace began its pilot in December 2016, when the bank tied up with Carro to launch a platform leveraging DBS’ website traffic to connect potential car buyers and sellers.

DBS is first Singapore bank to join global sustainability index,08 Aug 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_is_first_Singapore_bank_to_join_global_sustainability_index, Singapore ,"- DBS Group Holdings is the first Singapore bank to be included as an index constituent of the FTSE4Good Global Index, comprising more than 800 companies who have demonstrated good ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) practices, from around the world. DBS was also the top index constituent in the FTSE4Good ASEAN 5 Index. Inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index means that DBS is now one of eight Singapore-listed companies to be globally recognised for its ESG practices. Launched in 2001, the FTSE4Good Index Series is a series of benchmark and tradable indexes for ESG investors. It identifies companies that demonstrate strong ESG practices. To be included in this index, companies are independently assessed across more than 300 data points, which are applied according to the sectors and countries in which they operate. According to FTSE Russell, the consideration of ESG factors is now a core focus for many large institutional investors across asset owners, asset managers, consultants and banks. According to data from Global Sustainable Investment Alliance [1] , over USD22 trillion of assets are being professionally managed under responsible investment strategies, an increase of 25% since 2014. Mikkel Larsen, Co-Chair of DBS’ Sustainability Council said: “DBS’ inclusion in the FTSE4Good index, one of the world’s foremost indices that recognise ESG performance, now places us on the global stage. This is an affirmation that our sustainability efforts are on the right path, and we look forward to introducing more innovative initiatives to support Singapore and the region’s sustainable development agendas.” In recent years, DBS has been strengthening its sustainability agenda in various ways. Last month, the bank issued its first green bond with an issue size of USD500 million, to support the financing of green assets. It was the sole bookrunner of Singapore’s first corporate green bond in March 2017. The bank also played an instrumental role in bringing to market the world’s first listed social sustainability bond – the Women’s Livelihood Bond, a USD8 million bond that provides loans to social enterprises and microfinance institutions, positively impacting the livelihoods of more than 385,000 women in Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In addition, the DBS Foundation seeks to create social impact by championing social entrepreneurship in Asia, to address Asia’s evolving social needs. To date, DBS has reached out to more than 23,000 SEs and supported over 170 SEs with more than SGD 4 million in grant funding. As a responsible corporate citizen, there are ongoing efforts across the bank to cut its carbon emissions, such as incorporating sustainable designs and practices into DBS offices and branches. DBS was the first bank in Singapore to achieve the Green Mark certification endorsed by the National Environment Agency for its branch network in Singapore. Overall, the bank has received the certification for over 20 branches, with two receiving a Gold Plus Green Mark Award. In addition, the bank was conferred the BCA Green Mark Platinum and Gold Award for DBS Asia Central and DBS Academy earlier this year. DBS was also the first Asian bank to have its global international express shipments carbon neutral with the DHL GoGreen initiative.  DBS is also the first Singapore bank to adopt the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines in its 2015 annual report. GRI is an international independent standards organisation that helps businesses, governments and organisations understand and communicate their impact on sustainability issues.

DBS first-half earnings rise 4% to record SGD 2.35 billion | 繁體,04 Aug 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_FIRST_HALF_EARNINGS_RISE_4PCT_TO_RECORD_SGD_2_35_BILLION," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group achieved record net profit of SGD 2.35 billion for first-half 2017, up 4% from a year ago. Total income reached a half-year high of SGD 5.81 billion as broad-based loan growth and record fee income offset the impact of a lower net interest margin and weaker trading performance. The results were also underpinned by a decline in expenses from ongoing digitalisation and productivity initiatives and by lower allowances as non-performing loan formation moderated. For the second quarter, net profit rose 8% to SGD 1.14 billion. Total income of SGD 2.92 billion was just shy of a quarterly high as loans grew 2% over the quarter and fee income trends were sustained. Total allowances were 17% lower. The Board declared first-half dividends of SGD 33 cents per share, up 10% from the recent half-yearly payouts. The increase is consistent with the policy of paying progressive dividends in line with earnings while maintaining prudent capital levels to meet impending regulatory changes and long-term growth requirements. First-half net profit rises 4%  For the first half, net interest income increased 1% to SGD 3.72 billion. Loans rose 6% to SGD 303 billion from broad-based growth in corporate, trade, consumer and Singapore housing loans. The impact of higher loan volumes was partially offset by softer Singapore dollar interest rates, which resulted in a 12 basis point decline in net interest margin to 1.74%. Net fee income rose 8% to SGD 1.30 billion. Wealth management fees increased significantly to SGD 467 million from higher sales of unit trusts and other investment products. Higher trade finance and cash management income resulted in a 7% increase in transaction service fees to SGD 311 million. Card fees also grew from increased credit card transactions in Singapore and Hong Kong. Partially offsetting the growth in these activities were an 18% decline in investment banking fees from lower equity underwriting and a 5% fall in loan-related fees. Other non-interest income fell 14% or SGD 126 million to SGD 790 million due to lower trading gains and a non-recurring gain of SGD 38 million a year ago. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 10% to SGD 2.30 billion as all product segments were higher. In particular, income from investment products rose 21% led by higher sales of treasury products and unit trusts. Institutional Banking income fell 1% to SGD 2.62 billion as a 28% increase in cash management income was offset by lower income from other activities. Treasury Markets income fell 23% to SGD 445 million. Expenses declined 1% to SGD 2.52 billion as ongoing digitalisation and productivity initiatives yielded cost savings. Underlying headcount was 1% lower. The reduction in expenses improved the cost-income ratio by one percentage point to 43%. Profit before allowances was 2% higher at SGD 3.29 billion. Second-quarter earnings up 8% from a year ago For the second quarter, continued business momentum was offset by lower net interest margin, trading income and gains on investment securities. Net interest income was 3% higher than a year ago at SGD 1.89 billion. Loan growth of 6% more than offset the impact of a 13 basis point decline in net interest margin to 1.74%. Net fee income rose 1% to SGD 636 million. An increase in annuity fee income streams, led by double-digit growth in wealth management, was offset by a decline in investment banking and loan-related fees. Other non-interest income fell 13% to SGD 400 million from lower trading income and gains on investment securities as well as an absence of gains on fixed assets. Total income was slightly higher at SGD 2.92 billion. With expenses declining 1% to SGD 1.27 billion, the cost-income ratio improved one percentage point to 43%. Profit before allowances increased 1% to SGD 1.66 billion. Second-quarter earnings 6% lower than previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, second-quarter net profit was 6% lower. Total income increased 1% to a near quarterly high as net interest income rose. Net interest income increased 3% as loans grew 2% from higher corporate, trade, consumer and Singapore housing loans. Net interest margin was unchanged at 1.74% as the benefit of higher Singapore dollar interest rates was offset by lower Hong Kong dollar interest rates. Net fee income was 4% lower due to a decline in loan-related fees. Other fee income streams remained healthy, with wealth management, card and transaction service fees around recent quarterly highs. Other non-interest income was 3% higher as an improvement in trading income was partially offset by lower gains on investment securities. Profit before allowances was 1% higher as the higher total income was offset by a 2% increase in expenses. Balance sheet remains healthy  The amount of non-performing assets was little changed from the previous quarter at SGD 4.85 billion as non-performing loan formation was offset by write-offs and recoveries. For the first half, non-performing loan formation moderated from the high levels of the previous three quarters. The non-performing loan rate rose slightly from the previous quarter to 1.5%. Specific allowances amounted to SGD 304 million for the second quarter, bringing the half-year amount to SGD 504 million. Allowance coverage of non-performing assets was at 100% and at 234% when collateral was considered. Deposits rose 11% from a year ago to SGD 343 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio for the second quarter was 150%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the regulatory requirement due in 2018. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was at 14.4%. The leverage ratio of 7.9% was more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. The scrip dividend scheme will apply to the first-half dividend. Scrip dividends will be issued at the average of the closing share prices on 11, 14 and 15 August 2017. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We achieved strong operating performance in the first half and the business pipeline remains healthy, in line with general economic trends in our key markets. Asset quality pressures will continue and the risk of heightened credit costs in the oil and gas support services sector will persist with low oil prices. The 10% increase in dividends reflects the Board’s confidence in the quality of our earnings and our balance sheet, in particular the strong capital buffers we have built up. We are well positioned to continue capturing growth opportunities and delivering shareholder returns.” [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS and Xero launch new service for SMEs to instantly link their DBS bank accounts with Xero’s cloud accounting platform,01 Aug 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Xero_launch_new_service_for_SMEs_to_instantly_link_their_DBS_bank_accounts_with_Xeros_cloud_accounting_platform, Singapore ,"- DBS, Asia’s leading SME bank [1] , and Xero, a leading global cloud accounting platform, have today launched an API-driven bank feed integration that will transform how mutual customers in Singapore manage their finances.  This landmark collaboration allows small businesses to instantly connect their DBS business banking accounts to Xero so that their transaction data can flow securely and automatically into Xero each day. The business owner will get a reliable, up-to-date view of their financial position in Xero, empowering them to make more informed business and investment decisions, without the hassle and costly mistakes caused by outdated cash flow balances and human error.  The online integration is the first-of-its-kind in the region, as existing direct bank feed arrangements require SMEs to apply for the account integration via paper forms, and can take about 10 days to set up.  A recent survey of 150 non-Xero SMEs in Singapore by Xero found that:  · Singapore’s small business owners spend an average of 15.5 hours a month manually importing and reconciling their bank statements. · Of these, almost a third (30%) spend between 20 and 40 hours a month manually reconciling. · Over two thirds of small businesses (67%) cited manual bank statement reconciliation as a key challenge in managing their operations. · Of these, 17% cited this as the single biggest financial challenge facing their business.  This initiative eliminates the need for small businesses to undertake inconvenient and time-consuming activities such as manual data entry or importing bank transactions. The technology driving this integration allows small business customers who use DBS IDEAL, DBS’s online business banking platform, to opt in to have their bank transactions imported automatically into their nominated Xero subscription every day.  Joyce Tee, DBS Group Head of SME Banking said, “We have made it a priority to reimagine banking, seamlessly interweave banking into a customer’s everyday life by being part of their eco-system and to provide SMEs with business management tools to help them grow their business. By enabling SMEs to manage their finances in a much more efficient manner, we hope that they can better manage their business and make more informed decisions.”  Ng Peng Khim, Head of Institutional Banking Group Technology & Digital Banking, DBS Bank said, “DBS has been at the forefront of providing digital solutions to our SME customers. With this seamless API-led integration between DBS IDEAL Internet Banking and Xero, we are bringing banking services much closer to our customers. This integration is one of the first of an exciting series of digital solutions we are working with Xero to bring true efficiency gains and new insights to our SME customers.”  Rod Drury, Xero CEO and Founder said, “The future of finance is steeped in collaboration between banking institutions and technology companies. This is vital to the success of small businesses, and also for the effective future operation of the financial services sector. We are working with more than 140 financial and fintech organisations around the world to establish a global financial web which securely opens up data flows that can help de-risk lending and enable small businesses to access much-needed capital so that they can prosper.”  Alex Campbell, Xero Managing Director for Asia said, “As one of the world’s recognised leading digital banks, DBS is a natural partner for Xero to collaborate with and develop game-changing solutions to the financial management challenges that small businesses face every day. The launch of direct bank feeds is a foundational first step to further innovative, technology solutions from Xero and DBS for Singapore’s small businesses.”  DBS-Xero direct bank feeds are available free to all DBS business account customers who are Xero subscribers. New Xero customers who connect their DBS business accounts to Xero will get 25% off their monthly Xero subscription fees for the next 12 months (offer details apply).

DBS launches portal to help entrepreneurs set up their business in a day,24 Jul 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_portal_to_help_entrepreneurs_set_up_their_business_in_a_day, Singapore ,"- DBS has launched an online portal at https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/business-registration.page to help entrepreneurs set up their business within a day. Through the DBS Get Set portal, small business owners can appoint a company secretary to help them incorporate their business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and open a banking account at the same time, via a short online application process. Each year, around 35,000 small businesses are set up in Singapore and according to ACRA regulations, every company must appoint a company secretary within six months of incorporation [1] . While company directors can act as company secretary, professional corporate secretarial firms can value-add by providing accounting, business structure and tax advice. The company secretary is also responsible for ensuring a company adheres to mandatory reporting requirements of the Singapore Companies Act. From the DBS portal, business owners can compare the services and fees of up to five corporate secretarial firms at a glance. In addition, through the portal, SME owners can work with a range of service providers to help them adopt digital technologies easily and at preferential rates. For example, they can tap on Singtel’s Shoptiq e-commerce solution for only SGD0.99 per day to launch an online store. They can get hands-on support to set up their online store and create online content from students of Singapore Polytechnic’s Diploma in Media and Communication and Diploma in Business Information Technology. This is further complemented by online advertising solutions from Singtel’s Adtiq, or PurpleClick and Kobe. Other essential business services SMEs can sign up for include free trials on Xero, a cloud accounting software as well as mobile phone and HR software offers from StarHub and Talenox respectively. “The DBS Get Set portal makes it very easy for small business owners to set up their company. Being able to shorten the time required to start up a business from weeks to hours with only a small capital outlay helps SMEs concentrate on building their customer base,” said Ms Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank. “We continue to focus our efforts on helping SMEs build and enhance their capabilities in e-commerce and becoming more efficient by adopting web-based solutions.” For more information, SME owners can visit https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/business-registration.page .

IIX and DBS close world’s first listed social sustainability bond,06 Jul 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/IIX_and_DBS_close_worlds_first_listed_social_sustainability_bond, Singapore ,"- IIX (Impact Investment Exchange), a pioneer in impact investing and catalyst to social innovation, with the support of DBS Bank, has closed the world’s first social sustainability bond to be listed on a stock exchange, the Women’s Livelihood Bond (WLB). This innovative USD8 million bond provides loans to social enterprises and microfinance institutions, positively impacting the livelihoods of more than 385,000 women in Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The four-year bond offers a coupon rate of 5.65% per annum and is listed on the Singapore Exchange. The WLB received over 60% of its investment capital from Asian investors, with the majority being high net worth customers of DBS. The WLB includes a number of credit protection features, including USD500,000 of first-loss capital provided by IIX as well as a 50% guarantee of the principal amount of the underlying loan portfolio, provided by USAID. In addition to DBS, the WLB is supported by a diverse range of stakeholders from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors such as Shearman & Sterling, Hogan Lovells, the Rockefeller Foundation, U.S Agency for International Development (USAID), the Clinton Global Initiative, ANZ Banking Group, the Japan Research Institute, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. IIX intends to replicate the WLB across the globe and expects such future bonds to be listed on its Impact Exchange. “The closing of the Women’s Livelihood Bond is a landmark achievement for the impact investment market, demonstrating that impact investment products can achieve scale, transparency and liquidity and appeal to a wide range of investors,” said IIX’s Founder, Durreen Shahnaz. “The infrastructure for social capital markets is now taking off. This transaction brings us one step closer to a day when our financial markets consider social and environmental impact on an equal footing with financial returns.” “The WLB has brought in new stakeholders to the impact investment space thus expanding the ecosystem that supports transformative growth. At IIX, we are delighted to work with new partners such as DBS Bank, Shearman & Sterling, Hogan Lovells and ANZ Bank who have helped in supporting our efforts to create this innovative financial structure for social good. We look forward to bringing-in new partners into this exciting space of impact investing,” said Robert Kraybill, IIX Managing Director. DBS played an active role in bringing the WLB to fruition, in line with its commitment to promoting sustainable development in Asia. This includes championing the creation of social innovation and social enterprises through the DBS Foundation, as well as supporting financial inclusion for many segments of society. Said Leona Tan, Head of DBS Foundation and a member of DBS Sustainability Council, “As the former Development Bank of Singapore, DBS’ core belief is that business should touch real people, real businesses, real lives. We are a big believer of sustainable development, and are a supporter of the UN Sustainability Goals which seek to create decent work and economic growth, among other things. The WLB, and other similar instruments, will contribute towards these goals by providing social enterprises with the needed capital to build and scale their businesses, thereby creating jobs and strengthening livelihoods here in Asia.” Clifford Lee, DBS Group Head of Fixed Income said: “This is a good example of how the capital markets can be mobilised to support a worthwhile cause for the betterment of life for the less fortunate, and we are honored to have been involved in the structuring and marketing of this debut transaction for IIX.” Tan Su Shan, DBS Group Head of Consumer Banking/Wealth Management added: “We would like to acknowledge the support of our clients, who helped to make the WLB a reality. With Asia’s entrenched culture of giving, we see the WLB as a testament to the tremendous potential of impact investing in this region. Singapore is well-placed to become a regional hub for impact investing, leveraging the infrastructure and eco-system it has built as a leading hub for tech start-ups and tapping on the region’s unique intersection of wealth and socio-environmental needs. The WLB is a modest but important first step and we will continue to work closely with partners like IIX to bring innovative financial instruments to investors in Asia who are seeking to combine social and financial returns.” [End] About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

MSIG and DBS collaborate to bring instant travel claims payments to Singapore,05 Jul 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/MSIG_and_DBS_collaborate_to_bring_instant_travel_claims_payments_to_Singapore, Singapore ,"- MSIG Insurance and DBS Bank have announced the launch of Singapore’s first instant electronic payment service for travel insurance claims. The new initiative will reduce the time a travel claim is settled by approximately four days. DBS/POSB account holders who have bought MSIG’s travel insurance plans through the DBS website and have signed up for a member login account with MSIG’s customer portal will be able to benefit from this real-time claims payment service. This instant electronic payment service rides on DBS’ new API named DBS IDEAL RAPID. MSIG is the first company in Singapore to deploy this new service. The general insurer offers a wide spectrum of insurance solutions to DBS customers and around one out of two MSIG policies distributed through DBS were bought online last year. “Being the first to tap on the bank’s real-time payment service is a reflection of our long standing and solid partnership with DBS,” said Michael Gourlay, CEO of MSIG Insurance. “Technology is fast changing the way people are buying and interacting with the sellers. While digitisation can be wide spread, we will focus on initiatives that will truly help us to improve our customer’s journey and enhance their overall experience. Besides travel claims, we will look into introducing real-time electronic payment service across our whole enterprise,” he added. “We are delighted to support MSIG’s drive to re-define the customer’s travel insurance claims experience towards a more streamlined and immediate digital process by reducing the use of cheque payments. This collaboration is part of our broader strategy to work with our clients to co-create new digital experiences for their customers and partners. Our technology capabilities have enabled us to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Integrating DBS IDEAL RAPID into MSIG's claims processes is one example,” said Jeanette Wong, Group Head of Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank. In 2016, MSIG was named the Asia Pacific Insurer Claims Team of the Year by the Insurance Post Claims. This regional award recognises excellence in claims handling and other attributes. DBS continues to bring innovative solutions to benefit the insurance industry, an important client segment, and works closely with industry players to identify process improvement areas and customer pain points, with a view to re-define the end consumer’s experience. Today, a large part of the sector taps on the bank’s digital solutions such as payment of insurance premiums and signing up for GIRO deductions through AXS machines, Internet and mobile banking.

DBS – first bank in Singapore to launch financial planning centre offering free advisory services; no financial products sold,30 Jun 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_bank_in_Singapore_to_launch_financial_planning_centre_offering_free_advisory_services_no_financial_products_sold, Singapore ,"- DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, today launched “NAV Hub”, Singapore’s first financial planning centre by a bank which offers free advisory services, with no financial products being sold. Targeted at young adults, the “NAV Hub” is part of a new financial planning initiative by DBS named “NAV – Your Financial GPS”, aimed at helping customers navigate through life’s changes, uncertainties and opportunities. The “NAV Hub” is located in the central business district at Tanjong Pagar, and is the first of its kind to be set up by a bank in Singapore. Young adults can enjoy free personalised financial planning sessions with DBS’ NAV crew, where they can learn more about their current financial health, as well as understand their financial goals and how to achieve them. The financial planning sessions are conducted independent of sales and no financial products will be sold. They can also obtain financial planning tips from the NAV online space and attend monthly financial planning classes at the “NAV Hub” conducted by industry experts. To understand the aspirations and challenges faced by young adults in Singapore, DBS conducted a research study into its customers aged 20-35 (tertiary students, NSFs, first jobbers with less than two years of working experience, single working adults and married working adults), and the key findings include: • More than 50% of customers do not plan and do not know how to plan • 60% of young adults want to manage their money better to help them achieve their future goals • Their top three financial goals are: 1) Buying a home; 2) Growing their money; 3) Self-development (furthering studies, skills upgrade etc) • Majority of young adults who plan for financial goals do not know the estimated target amount needed to achieve each goal There are two groups of customers who will benefit the most from the services of “NAV – Your Financial GPS”. The first group is young adults who are novices in financial planning and need help to get started. The second group is people who may have taken some actions towards their goals and require further guidance. To help these groups of people who may find financial planning conversations daunting, DBS collaborated with various partners such as IDEO, a human-centred design agency to develop innovative tools to make these conversations fun and engaging. Said Mr Brandon Lam, DBS’ Singapore Head of Financial Planning Group, “We designed ‘NAV – Your Financial GPS’ as an interactive concept for young adults to fully understand their financial health and make concrete plans to work towards their financial goals. These could be conversations on buying their first homes, getting married, raising children, growing their money or retiring comfortably. The ‘NAV Hub’ provides a relaxed environment for these conversations to take place and we are committed to be their trusted partner on their financial planning journeys.” Said Mr Jonathan Tan Jun Jie, a 19-year-old student who went through the personalised financial planning session, “The ‘NAV Hub’ and its programme have given me a great insight to my future of financial planning. It’s shown me the progress and problems of my savings, and also an evaluation of my assets. The NAV crew also gave me tips and suggestions on ways I could go about doing my saving plans for my future and it has helped me to better understand my current financial situation. I would definitely recommend youths that have not yet started financial planning to go for a session as it would really help them understand the financial position they are in.” Please visit “ NAV – Your Financial GPS ” for more information.

DBS named most valuable brand in Singapore for fifth straight year,12 Jun 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_most_valuable_brand_in_Singapore_for_fifth_straight_year, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank continues to be Singapore’s Most Valuable Brand, according to Brand Finance’s annual “Top 100 Singapore Brands” report. With a brand value of USD 5.4 billion, this is the fifth consecutive year the bank has retained its leadership position in Singapore. According to Brand Finance, DBS has a significant lead vis a vis the rest of the pack, with close to USD 1.8 billion of brand value between itself and the second-most valuable brand. Given this strength, it is “unlikely that DBS… will be dethroned from the top of the Brand Finance Top 100 Most Valuable Singapore Brands table”, the London-based consultancy added. Samir Dixit, Managing Director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific said, “DBS is in a very strong position and it will continue to grow its brand strength and brand value given the ANZ acquisition. The strong and stable brand strength indicates that DBS is highly focused on their brand growth and makes concentrated efforts to build their brand and not just products to differentiate themselves. A strong brand further allows them to be competitive regionally and not just locally.” He added, “What made Singapore Airlines the #1 brand for several years and now DBS the #1 brand for five years is their ability to drive the strength of their brand. Both are AAA rated brands, clearly indicating that their brand is driving the business."" In October last year, DBS announced the acquisition of ANZ’s wealth and retail banking business in five markets, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Indonesia. The transaction cements the bank’s position as a leading wealth player in Asia, and also enables a rapid scale-up of its digital strategy in Indonesia and Taiwan. Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, DBS Bank said, “While banking as an industry is being disrupted, we have sought in recent years to embrace these changes by reimagining banking and the way we do marketing. We are delighted that these efforts have been recognised time and again, with DBS having been named World’s Best Digital Bank last year, and now, Singapore’s most valuable brand for the fifth year. We will continue to embed ourselves in the customer’s journey and to operate like a 22,000-person startup, delivering digitally innovative solutions so as to make banking simpler and faster.” London-based Brand Finance is an independent brand strategy and valuation consultancy. The Singapore Top 100 Brands report is published annually and incorporates data from all listed companies. Each brand is accorded a brand rating: a benchmarking study of the strength, risk and future potential of a brand relative to its competitor set; and a brand value, which is a summary measure of the financial strength of the brand.

DBS Marina Regatta makes Asia history with first public intel drone light show,26 May 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Marina_Regatta_makes_Asia_history_with_first_public_intel_drone_light_show, Singapore ,"- DBS Marina Regatta will debut yet another first-of-its-kind experience come 4 June night. As a finale to the DBS Marina Regatta, DBS will partner Intel to bring to audiences at the Marina Bay a tightly choreographed mass drone display that celebrates the fusion of technology and artistry. This will be the first time that the Intel® Shooting Star™ drone fleet will appear in a public performance in Asia. 50 Intel drones will light up the skies in front of the Marina Bay Promontory in a three-minute performance at 8:15pm on 4 June. Flying in dynamic formations, the drones will showcase different shapes and colours to reveal a bespoke animation designed specifically for the DBS Marina Regatta. Dancing in mid-air to a specially commissioned musical piece by Singaporean composer and music producer, Eric Wong (United Records), the show promises to awe with its precision and finesse in a beautifully choreographed display. The drones also recently made headlines around the world and went viral on social media after they were shown in Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl Halftime performance in the US earlier this year. Said Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing and Communications, DBS Bank, “This will be a unique light extravaganza and we are delighted to partner leading technology company Intel to make this possible. Having Asia’s first drone display in DBS Marina Regatta’s finale will aptly cap off Singapore's biggest bay festival. It also gives us great pleasure to work with homegrown music talent, Eric Wong, as he brings to life his innovative and contemporary take on 'fireworks' and we hope the performance will be a memorable crowd pleaser.” ""We are excited to bring our Drone Light Show to the first ever public show in Asia. Singapore is the perfect venue for such an occasion and we are looking forward to debuting the Intel Shooting Star drones with DBS,” said Natalie Cheung, General Manager of Drone Light Shows at Intel. Unlike traditional fireworks, the drones are purpose built for light shows and are inherently environmentally friendly. Intel drones weigh about 11 ounces. They are made of flexible plastic and foam, and the propellers are covered by protective cages. Each drone is equipped with built-in LED lights that can create over 4 billion colour combinations. The fleet of drones is controlled by one pilot. Intel is a pioneer in drone technology choreography, thrilling audiences all over the world with dazzling displays. Using the Intel drone fleet, Intel set a Guinness World Records achievement in 2016 for Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) being airborne simultaneously. This year’s regatta will also feature the following first-of-its-kind experiences • SEA’s largest ever pop-up urban beach at over 21,000 sq ft – or the size of 1.5 Olympic pools, filled with sand weighing over 151,000 kg – or about 8 truckloads. It is twice the size of last year’s urban beach and can fit up to 2,000 people.  • SG’s largest inflatable water obstacle course, Battle Bay, at over 11,000 sq ft with nine obstacles.

DBS – first Asian bank to ‘go green’ fully with DHL Express,09 May 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_Asian_bank_to_go_green_fully_with_DHL_Express, Singapore ,"- DHL Express, the world’s leading international express services provider, and DBS Bank, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, today announced a three-year GoGreen partnership. From 2017 to 2019, all DBS international express shipments will be delivered via DHL GoGreen Climate Neutral Service. This landmark collaboration sees DBS as the first Asian bank to fully utilise the logistics company’s GoGreen offering. DHL GoGreen Climate Neutral Service is an eco-friendly solution which allows DBS to send carbonneutral shipments and provides the bank visibility into its carbon footprint. Using a DHL patented methodology, DHL Express will calculate and estimate the CO2 emissions of every DBS shipment based on their weight and distance travelled. These emissions are offset through reinvestments by the DHL carbon management programme, into global climate protection projects such as a biomass power plant in India and wind farms in the eastern and north-central regions of China. At the end of each year, DBS will receive an annual certificate that details the estimated carbon emissions from its GoGreen shipments that were neutralised in environmental protection projects. The entire process, including the certification, is annually verified by an independent third party to ensure accountability. Donna Trowbridge, Group Head of Procurement Services, DBS Bank said: “We believe that we have a role to play in promoting sustainable development, recognising that one of the things that uniquely defines us is our sense of purpose, which stems from our heritage as the Development Bank of Singapore. Participating in this innovative initiative is another step we are taking to actively manage our carbon footprint, complementing ongoing efforts to cut our carbon emissions such as incorporating sustainable designs and practices into our offices and branches.” “As large global companies, we have the power to make huge waves not only in the economy but also in the well-being of societies and the environment. Hence, we are obligated to utilise business practices that ensure both quality of service and the future of our green environment. This partnership brings together two industry leaders to maximise our positive impact on current environmental issues. It signals our commitment to green policies and we hope to encourage the wider community to engage in such practices that benefit the earth as well,” said Frank-Uwe Ungerer, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, DHL Express Singapore. In 2016, DBS’ carbon emissions across its offices and branches in six key markets (Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan) fell by 4%. This reflects the bank’s ongoing environmentally-friendly efforts, which include reducing air travel by encouraging alternatives such as videoconferencing and online collaboration tools. DBS was also the first bank in Singapore to achieve the Green Mark certification endorsed by the National Environment Agency for its branch network in Singapore. Overall, the bank has received the certification for over 20 branches, with two receiving a Gold Plus Green Mark Award. The DHL GoGreen policy is part of Deutsche Post DHL Group’s commitment to contribute to the communities and regions in which the company operates, and earlier this year, it announced its goal of reducing all logistics-related emissions to net zero by the year 2050. The GoGreen programme covers all environmental issues including environmental management, waste consumption, and sustainable sourcing. In Singapore, DHL Express tracks its annual carbon emissions and is committed to various green initiatives. It is the official logistics partner of the RENEW programme, Singapore’s most extensive and inclusive e-waste recycling initiative.

DBS grooms new generation of digital bankers in second edition of the DBS UNI.CORN internship programme,08 May 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_grooms_new_generation_of_digital_bankers_in_second_edition_of_the_DBS_UNICORN_internship_programme, Singapore ,"- After the resounding success of the inaugural DBS UNI.CORN programme last year, DBS will kick off the second year of this innovative internship programme with 24 interns starting their 12-week internship today. The 2017 intake was expanded by 50%, from 16 to 24 interns this year, reflecting the programme’s success and popularity among university students. This year, DBS also received over 1,000 applications, a five-fold increase from the previous year. The 24 penultimate-year university students are from diverse disciplines, including banking and finance, engineering, liberal arts, computer science and multimedia design. They were selected based on their ability to solve problems and work in a team. Unlike conventional internship programmes, the curriculum for the DBS UNI.CORN internship programme enables them to develop prototypes to address specific business problems. Working in teams of four, each team will be assigned a business problem statement from either the bank’s consumer banking, SME banking or technology units. Interns will be taught the agile methodology framework and will spend the next 12 weeks conceptualising, testing and developing a solution to address the problem statement. The internship concludes with a Demo Day, where each team will showcase their solutions to the bank’s senior management. UNI.CORNs will also get an opportunity to see their prototype ideas implemented. Solutions presented by the inaugural batch of interns were tested within the respective business units. For example, one of the prototypes, an e-dollar Ang Bao on DBS PayLah mobile wallets, was even introduced as a trial to DBS staff during Chinese New Year. Said Neal Cross, DBS’ Chief Innovation Officer, “An agile and innovative workforce will help make Singapore’s Smart Nation ambition a reality and we are excited to be a part of this by nurturing the next generation of digital bankers, strengthening Singapore’s talent pool. We are thrilled to have the second batch of UNI.CORNs join us on our digital transformation journey and we hope that they will take away with them a new way of working that will help shape the future of banking.” Applications were open to all penultimate-year students in Singapore. Applicants were asked to complete a game designed by the bank, complete cognitive assignments and submit a video about themselves. Shortlisted applicants were then invited to take part in a 12-hour Idea Smash hackathon, where their problem solving skills and ability to work in a team were evaluated. The DBS UNI.CORN programme is part of the bank’s strategy to develop and groom the future generation of digital bankers, as it seeks to act like a 22,000-person start up, able to respond and innovate quickly to deliver simple, fast and contextual banking in the digital age. Up to 150 interns and new graduates each year are put through various training initiatives where they can be immersed in new technologies, a start-up culture, agile methodology and other digital working concepts, in addition to accelerated training, job rotations, networking sessions and mentoring from senior leaders.

DBS first-quarter net profit at record SGD 1.21 billion | 繁體,02 May 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_quarter_net_profit_at_record_SGD_1_21_Billion," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group’s net profit for first-quarter 2017 rose to a record SGD 1.21 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Business momentum remained healthy with fee income climbing to a record. Productivity gains resulted in 1% reduction in expenses and a one percentage point improvement in the cost-income ratio compared to a year ago. Specific allowances eased from recent quarters as non-performing loan formation moderated. Allowance coverage of non-performing assets was at 103%. Including one-time items, net profit was SGD 1.25 billion. As previously announced, there was a gain of SGD 350 million from the divestment of PWC Building in Singapore. The amount was set aside as general allowances, raising general allowance reserves to SGD 3.49 billion. In addition, SGD 10 million of integration costs for the retail and wealth management business acquired from ANZ was accrued. The general allowance and integration cost charges had a tax impact of SGD 45 million. Net profit 1% higher than a year ago Net interest income was unchanged from a year ago at SGD 1.83 billion. The impact of softer Singapore-dollar interest rates was offset by higher loan volumes, which rose 7% in constant-currency terms to SGD 298 billion from growth in corporate, trade and Singapore housing loans. Net fee income rose 16% to SGD 665 million. The growth was led by a 26% increase in wealth management fees to a quarterly high of SGD 222 million from stronger sales of unit trusts and other investment products. Transaction service fees increased 11% to SGD 157 million due to higher trade finance and cash management income. Investment banking fees doubled to SGD 45 million from increased equity and fixed income fees. Cards and loan-related fees were also higher. Other non-interest income fell 15% or SGD 68 million to SGD 390 million due to lower trading gains and a non-recurring net gain of SGD 38 million a year ago. Income from treasury customer sales was little changed at SGD 304 million with an increase in wealth management treasury sales offset by a decline in corporate treasury sales. By business unit, income for Consumer Banking / Wealth Management rose 13% to SGD 1.16 billion. The increase was across all product segments and led by double-digit percentage growth in investment products. Institutional Banking income was stable at SGD 1.32 billion as higher transaction service income was offset by lower treasury customer income. Treasury Markets income fell 39% to SGD 187 million. Total income rose 1% to SGD 2.89 billion. Expenses declined 1% to SGD 1.25 billion as productivity gains arising from concerted digitalisation and cost management efforts enabled the bank to support higher business volumes with fewer resources. The positive jaw resulted in a one percentage point improvement in the cost-income ratio to 43% and contributed to a 2% increase in profit before allowances to SGD 1.64 billion. Net profit 33% higher than previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, net profit was 33% higher as specific allowances fell. Net interest income rose 3% on a day-adjusted basis. Net interest margin increased three basis points to 1.74% due to higher interest rates in Hong Kong and Singapore. Loans increased 1% in constant-currency terms from growth in trade loans. Net fee income rose 29%, led by a 41% increase in wealth management and 60% increase in loan-related fees. Other income fell 11% as lower trading gains were partially offset by an increase in treasury customer income and gains from investment securities. Total income increased 4% compared to a 2% rise in expenses. Profit before allowances was 5% higher. Balance sheet remains healthy Compared to the previous quarter, the amount of non-performing assets fell slightly to SGD 4.83 billion. The non-performing loan rate was unchanged at 1.4%. Non-performing loan formation, which had been elevated in recent quarters due to stresses in the oil and gas support services sector, moderated and was offset by recoveries and write-offs. Specific allowance charges amounted to SGD 200 million or 26 basis points of loans, compared to 38 basis points for full-year 2016. Allowance coverage was at 103% and at 217% when collateral was considered. Deposits rose 7% from a year ago and were stable from the previous quarter in constant-currency terms to SGD 342 billion. The liquidity coverage ratio was 138%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was above the regulatory requirement due in 2018. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio rose 0.5 percentage points from the previous quarter to 14.6%. The increase was due to higher retained earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets due partly to currency effects. The leverage ratio of 7.9% was more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We have had a good start to the year. Earnings were maintained at the quarterly high achieved a year ago as business momentum and productivity gains were sustained, offsetting the impact of a lower net interest margin. Our business pipeline is healthy, consistent with the recent improvement in economic data for key markets. While asset quality pressures appear to be moderating, we remain vigilant to continued headwinds in the oil and gas support services sector. Our diversified business lines, nimbleness in execution and strong balance sheet put us in good stead for the coming year.” [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS Marina Regatta 2017 returns with high-octane thrills on land & water,25 Apr 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Marina_Regatta_2017_returns_with_high_octane_thrills_on_land_and_water, Singapore ,"- DBS Marina Regatta 2017 (DBSMR 2017), Singapore’s Biggest BayFest, returns with high-octane thrills and spills on land and water. From 1 to 4 June 2017, DBS Marina Regatta 2017 will be packed with a slate of unmissable activities to take outdoor enthusiasts, fitness lovers and partygoers alike from day to night, while watching the region’s top dragon boating teams battle it out against the iconic Marina Bay skyline for Asia’s highest prize purse of SGD 134,000. True to form, the regatta continues to introduce unique new experiences with the debut of Singapore’s largest giant inflatable water obstacle course and Singapore’s largest interactive art dome. Sim S. Lim, DBS Singapore Country Head, said, “When we made our commitment to enlivening the Bay in 2013, we set out to bring community programmes to the public that would encourage them to see and experience all the Bay has to offer. This includes the DBS Marina Regatta, which has evolved into the Bay’s premier event, attracting tens of thousands of eventgoers each year. In Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s 2010 Marina Bay City Gallery opening speech, he hoped that the Bay would come to define Singapore, in the same way that the Bund defines the city of Shanghai. Today, the Bay is renowned across the world, filled with dynamism and vibrancy – and we are glad to have contributed some part in making the vision of the Bay for people to live, work and play a reality.” Said Karen Ngui, Group Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, “It’s been quite a journey, evolving the DBS Marina Regatta from its modest beginnings in 2012 to Singapore’s Biggest Watersports Fest and now Singapore’s Biggest BayFest. From water to land, we have a packed slate of unmissable events for sports, fitness, wellness, and music lovers alike – it’s the event of the year for anyone who loves high-energy and high-octane thrills from day to night.” As part of DBS’ continued efforts to champion the development of the social entrepreneurship sector to build a socially-conscious society, social enterprises such MINDS, Society Staples and Bettr Barista will provide many of the services in the regatta such as drinking water, catering and event organisation. They will also feature as vendors in the regatta’s art market and food village. BAYFEST ON WATER 1) DRAGON BOATING – Region’s top teams compete for Asia’s highest prize purse  Organised in partnership with the Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA), this year’s international dragon boat competition will see an estimated 90 teams and more than 3,000 athletes gathering on the waters of Marina Bay to compete for cash prizes totalling SGD 134,000 – the highest for the sport in Asia. Dr Chia Shi-Lu, President of the SDBA said, “It’s been immensely gratifying to see how much the dragon boating community has grown both in Singapore and the region over the years with DBS’ instrumental support. The growth of the regatta and its supporters bear testament to the great strides DBS has made in elevating the sport locally and across the region.” 2) SAILING – Explore the Bay’s waters on DBS’ 18-metre-tall mega sailboats Eventgoers will also get to try out sailing in the Bay during the regatta with DBS’ 18-metre tall Swedish Match 40 sailboats – the first of its kind in Asia. The sailboats were debuted in 2015 as part of the DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme, which has been offering the public complimentary sailing sessions in the Bay since 2013. BAYFEST ON LAND This year also sees DBS Marina Regatta 2017 partnering up with electronic music festival behemoth Ultra, urban fitness brand lululemon, Bali’s famed beach club Potato Head and F&B curators The Local People. 1) BATTLE BAY – Take on Singapore’s largest inflatable water obstacle course DBS Marina Regatta 2017 sees the debut of Singapore’s biggest inflatable water obstacle course. Spanning over 11,000 square feet (some 1,100 square metres), the Battle Bay will feature nine challenging obstacles to navigate including balance blocks, monkey bars, wall scaling, and rope swings. 2) BAY BEACH – Singapore’s only pop-up urban beach returns bigger & better This year, the Bay will once again be transformed into Singapore’s one and only pop-up urban beach, which will double in size from last year. Bali beach club Potato Head will be bringing in their legendary Coconut Bar here for the first time, complete with their signature uber fresh coconut cocktails and beers. 3) BAY DOME – Singapore’s largest interactive art dome This year will see the installation of two majestic nine- and 7.5-metre tall domes at the regatta. Reaching a height of 7.5 metres, the Bay Dome will offer an immersive interactive art experience – Singapore’s largest – with an illustrated projection of the Marina Bay skyline. Eventgoers can customise their own characters and have their designs come to life on the projection to create an ever-evolving digital canvas. 4) BAY EATS – Offerings from Singapore’s top young chefs For foodies, the regatta’s food village Bay Eats, will be curated by The Local People and feature food stalls from award-winning and the top new eateries in town such as the “Neo-Sin” restaurant Labyrinth, French eatery Garçons, The BellJar, Leng Leng ice cream and more. 5) PLAY DOME – Play in the day, party at night The nine-metre-tall Play Dome will host many of the fitness classes launched by lululemon during the day. At night, the DBSMR X Ultra Countdown Party will take place exclusively at the regatta from 7pm to 10pm, on Friday and Saturday evening (2 & 3 June). The pre-parties will feature three Ultra Music Festival deejays every night, such as Dubvision, Crossnaders, Raiden, Jade Rasif, Moe and Myrne. Since 2012, as part of the bank’s continuing efforts to bring the Bay to the people, and the people to the Bay, DBS/POSB initiatives such as the DBS Marina Regatta, DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme, POSB PAssion Run for Kids, and its other complimentary cycling and yoga activities have attracted more than 80,000 to the Bay – transforming Marina Bay into a bustling hub of activity.

DBS and Xero join forces to revolutionise how SMEs manage capital,09 Mar 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Xero_join_forces_to_revolutionise_how_SMEs_manage_capital, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank and Xero , a leading global cloud accounting platform, announced a strategic partnership to transform the way SMEs in Singapore manage their financials and access capital. The partnership is centred on several aspects including aligning both parties’ technology platforms to ultimately enable SMEs to make payments and apply for loans seamlessly, transforming how SMEs manage cash flow and access capital. The first step in the partnership is connecting SMEs’ bank accounts with Xero’s online accounting software. This will allow SME customers to access in real-time, a consolidated view of their financial accounts, including cash in the bank, from any device, anytime in the day.  The integration in data on one portal will enable business owners to make smarter investment and management decisions. This seamless connection is the first-of-its-kind in Asia and will be available in 2017. Another aspect of the collaboration will see DBS and Xero working together, capitalising on APIs, to make business-to-business payments easier. Ultimately, the aim is to enable a DBS-Xero customer to access capital more efficiently.  With the partnership, SMEs can grant banks access to their real-time financial data, which will provide a richer financial picture of their business. The integration aims to remove much of the administrative burden for SMEs when they apply for bank loans. “With this strategic partnership, we are empowering our SME clients to make better business decisions by making cash flow management transparent and simple. In addition, as the bank will have better access to the SMEs’ financial data, the application process for bank loans will be further streamlined and simplified. This ties back to our vision of reimagining banking to make banking joyful,” said Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS. “Xero is in the unique and privileged position of being able to understand our subscribers’ needs to grow and thrive,” said Rod Drury, CEO and Founder of Xero.  “We’re delighted to connect SMEs and a leading local financial institution like DBS. DBS, together with Xero, has the potential to connect more small businesses to the financial services they need and empower them to run their businesses even more efficiently.” “At Xero, we are passionate about helping SMEs to be successful and we are excited to partner with DBS as the world’s leading digital bank,” said Alex Campbell, Managing Director of Xero Asia. “Bank feeds lay the foundation of the financial web, which comprises a network of trusted organisations sharing financial data securely with the purpose of making doing business easier for SMEs. It enables small business owners, working in the cloud, to do their bank reconciliations on their mobile phone while travelling into work, or capture a daily view of their cash flow - thus, ending the monthly stress of catch-up when consolidated bank statements come through. As simple as this sounds, it fundamentally changes how a business can operate – anytime, from any device with insights - to help them make decisions on the fly,” said Campbell. Deepening the relationships between small businesses and major enterprises like DBS is part of Xero’s vision to enable small businesses to thrive through better tools, information and connections.

The new jobs will help DBS cement its position as a leading digital bank. Taking an innovative approach to recruitment, DBS will break industry norms and identify successful candidates through a coding challenge and hackathon - the first bank in Southeast Asia to do so. Both fresh graduates and experienced professionals can apply. “We are seeing rapid advancements in banking technology using cloud, machine learning and Big Data, which are paving the way for a new world of seamless banking. We want to bring developers well-versed in these new technologies into the bank to accelerate our digital transformation efforts. We believe that recruiting via a hackathon is an innovative and effective way to attract the right talent,” said Soh Siew Choo, DBS’ Group Head of Core Systems Technology. The recruitment drive, DBS Hack2Hire, consists of two parts - an online assessment challenge to gauge the programming and technical capabilities of candidates, followed by a live two-day hackathon session, where their approach to problem solving will be put to the test. Shortlisted candidates from the second round will be offered full-time roles at DBS. DBS Hack2Hire is conducted in collaboration with leading technology providers Amazon Web Services, Cloudera and Pivotal. “We are pleased to play a strategic role in accelerating DBS Bank’s digital transformation journey with Amazon Web Services.  It is impressive that a financial institution like DBS is using new, innovative ways to bring in talent with cloud development skills, and we are delighted to support them while grooming the technology leaders of tomorrow,” said Nick Walton, Head of ASEAN of Amazon Web Services. “As the banking industry and its customers embrace digital in the face of the fourth industrial revolution, the need to utilise data for meaningful decision making and improving customer experience will only keep growing.” said Daniel Ng, Senior Director, Asia Pacific, Cloudera. “Bringing in talent with this new approach demonstrates DBS’ commitment to transforming its operations.

Moreover, DBS’ transformation journey will enable greater possibilities and opportunities for their business, customers and the country’s workforce. We are extremely happy to collaborate with DBS in their transformation efforts to push the frontier of banking technology.” Over the last five years, DBS has made significant investments in strategic technology initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time on people or things that they care about. This includes initiating a comprehensive re-architecture of the bank’s technology as well as catalysing a change in culture within the bank to one that is more “fintech-like” in nature. DBS launched digibank , India’s first mobile-only bank, last year and has plans to introduce this groundbreaking service in other markets.

DBS full-year 2016 net profit at SGD 4.24 billion | 繁體,16 Feb 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_full_year_2016_net_profit_at_SGD_4_24_billion," Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Regional ","- DBS Group reported net profit of SGD 4.24 billion for 2016, 2% below a year ago as a stronger operating performance was offset by higher allowances. Total income rose 6% to a record SGD 11.5 billion from higher loan volumes, improved net interest margin and broad-based non-interest income growth. Productivity gains from digitalisation and cost management initiatives contained expense growth to 1%. As a result, profit before allowances increased 10% to a new high of SGD 6.52 billion. The strong operating performance provided headroom for higher specific allowances to be taken as the non-performing loan rate rose from 0.9% to 1.4% due largely to stresses in the oil and gas support services sector. Capital and liquidity continued to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. Return on equity was 10.1%. The strong operating performance that DBS achieved in challenging conditions during the year underscored the resilience of a franchise built on multiple business lines and financial discipline. On 10 February 2017, DBS announced that it had sold its equity interest in DBS China Square Limited, whose main asset is PWC Building in Singapore. The divestment gains of SGD 350 million, which will be recorded in the first quarter 2017 results, will be set aside as general allowances, raising general allowance reserves to SGD 3.52 billion and allowance coverage to 104%. Broad-based growth underpins 6% increase in full-year total income growth Net interest income rose 3% to SGD 7.31 billion. Net interest margin increased three basis points to 1.80% from Singapore-dollar loans. Overall loans rose 6% or SGD 18 billion to SGD 302 billion. Non-trade loans increased 8% or SGD 21 billion from regional corporate loan growth and market share gains in Singapore housing loans, partially offset by a 5% or SGD 2 billion decline in trade loans. Non-interest income increased 13% to SGD 4.18 billion. Net fee income rose 9% to SGD 2.33 billion from broad-based growth. Wealth management fees climbed 19% to a new high of SGD 714 million from stronger bancassurance income. Cards fees grew 11% to SGD 483 million from higher credit and debit card transactions in Singapore. Investment banking fees increased 15% to SGD 189 million from higher advisory and equity underwriting fees. Higher fees from cash management resulted in a 5% increase in transaction services fees to SGD 585 million. Other non-interest income rose 19% to SGD 1.85 billion from higher trading income and gains on investment securities. Income from treasury customer sales was little changed at SGD 1.19 billion as higher wealth management treasury sales were offset by a decline in corporate treasury sales of RMB hedging products. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 21% to SGD 4.28 billion. The growth was broad-based across loans, deposits, bancassurance and cards. Wealth Management customer segment income increased 19% to SGD 1.68 billion with assets under management growing 14% during the year to SGD 166 billion. Institutional Banking income was stable at SGD 5.22 billion. Growth in cash management and capital market activities was offset by declines in China-related trade finance and treasury sales of RMB hedging products. Treasury segment income was also stable at SGD 1.13 billion. Past investments to digitalise the bank together with cost management initiatives yielded faster productivity gains during the year. These concerted efforts enabled expenses to be contained at SGD 4.97 billion, little changed from the previous year. Underlying headcount fell 1% as the productivity gains enabled higher business volumes to be supported by fewer resources. The positive jaw resulted in an improvement in the cost-income ratio from 45% to 43% and contributed to a 10% increase in profit before allowances to SGD 6.52 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings 9% lower than a year ago For the fourth quarter, net profit declined 9% from a year ago to SGD 913 million. Total income rose 5% to SGD 2.78 billion as non-interest income growth more than offset the impact of a lower net interest margin. The productivity gains from digitalisation and cost management initiatives resulted in a 2% decline in expenses, which contributed to a 10% increase in profit before allowances to SGD 1.55 billion. The improved operating performance was more than offset by a doubling of total allowances. Net interest income fell 2% to SGD 1.82 billion as a decline in net interest margin more than offset the impact of loan growth. Net interest margin fell 13 basis points to 1.71% as Singapore-dollar interest rates were lower compared to a year ago. Loans were 6% higher. Non-interest income increased 19% to SGD 952 million. Net fee income rose 6% to SGD 515 million, led by growth in wealth management and cards income. Other non-interest income grew 40% to SGD 437 million from higher trading income and wealth management treasury customer sales. The 2% decline in expenses resulting from productivity gains resulted in a three percentage improvement in the cost-income ratio to 44%. Fourth-quarter earnings decline 15% from previous quarter  Compared to the previous quarter, fourth-quarter net profit was 15% lower as seasonal factors contributed to a 5% decline in total income and 2% increase in expenses. Profit before allowances was 10% lower. Net interest income was stable as the impact of a lower net interest margin was offset by higher asset volumes. Net interest margin fell six basis points to 1.71% as Singapore-dollar loans continued to be re-priced in line with lower average interest rates and a more liquid balance sheet was maintained. Overall loans increased 4% due mainly to currency effects. Underlying loan growth was 1% from an increase in regional corporate and Singapore housing loans. Non-interest income was 15% lower. Net fee income declined 16% as higher cards income was more than offset by declines in other fee activities. Other non-interest income fell 13%. An increase in trading income was more than offset by a decline in treasury customer sales and gains on investment securities. There had also been a gain from the disposal of a property in the previous quarter. Higher non-performing loan rate  The non-performing loan rate rose from 0.9% a year ago and 1.3% from the third quarter to 1.4%. Total allowances for the full year and for the fourth quarter doubled from a year ago to SGD 1.43 billion and SGD 462 million respectively. A significant part of the increase in non-performing loans and specific allowances for the full year and fourth quarter was due to stresses in the oil and gas support services sector. Capital and liquidity remain strong Deposits rose 9% from a year ago to SGD 347 billion. Compared to the previous quarter, underlying deposits excluding currency effects increased 4%. The liquidity coverage ratio for the fourth quarter was 133%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the regulatory requirement due in 2018. Capital remained strong. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 14.1%. The leverage ratio of 7.7% was more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. The Board proposed a final dividend of 30 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This will bring the full-year dividend to 60 cents per share, unchanged from a year ago. The scrip dividend scheme will be applicable and scrip dividends will be issued at the average of the closing share prices on 4, 5 and 8 May 2017. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We achieved a 10% increase in full-year profit before allowances despite a challenging operating environment. The strong operating performance is the payoff from investments we made to build multiple business engines and to digitalise the bank. They enabled us to meet headwinds related to China and stresses in the oil and gas support services sector. The financial discipline we exercised over the years in building up buffers for capital, liquidity and allowance reserves has ensured that our balance sheet remains resilient. Our financial strength will stand us in good stead in the coming year as we continue supporting customers and delivering shareholder returns.”"

Order food online and go cashless with DBS FasTrack-powered apps,08 Feb 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Order_food_online_and_go_cashless_with_DBS_FasTrack_powered_apps, Singapore ,"- After a year in pilot, DBS’ unique online food ordering and cashless payment solution for F&B businesses in Singapore – DBS FasTrack – has now been officially launched. Marking this launch, Koufu, one of Singapore’s leading foodcourts, will become the first foodcourt in Singapore to debut the full implementation of its DBS FasTrack-powered app at shopping mall 100 AM on Tras Street. The public can now order and make cashless payments for their food via Koufu’s app and collect their meals at any of the14 stalls at the foodcourt without queueing – a first in Singapore. Going forward, Koufu plans to implement the DBS FasTrack online food ordering and cashless payment solution across its outlets, starting with some 100 stalls islandwide. In addition, DBS’ partner Applied Mesh has obtained pre-qualification under IMDA’s enhanced iSPRINT programme, so SMEs can implement the DBS FasTrack online food ordering and cashless payment solution at lower cost. Jointly developed by DBS and solutions provider Applied Mesh, DBS FasTrack can help F&B businesses tackle many of their current challenges such as high operating costs and manpower challenges. It is the first solution of its kind – an online food ordering and cashless payment app – co-produced by a Singapore bank. Said Mr Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “Innovation is the lifeblood of DBS and of Singapore. As we continually strive to create innovations that better our lives and businesses, having the support of IMDA helps in ensuring the sustainability and widespread implementation of such solutions. Their endorsement of Applied Mesh as a pre-qualified solution bears tremendous significance for DBS FasTrack , it affirms our faith that Singapore-borne solutions can tangibly benefit and improve the productivity of F&B businesses here for years to come. Apart from businesses, the solution benefits customers as it completely removes the need for queuing. Designed to provide a seamless ordering and payments experience – DBS FasTrack is easy to use and completely intuitive. We are also excited to be introducing new milestones in Singapore, with the public now able to pre-order and pay for their meals in a foodcourt using an app for the first time.” Said Mr Chia Hee Meng, CEO and founder of Applied Mesh, “We at Applied Mesh are excited to partner DBS Bank, enabling DBS merchants and customers to order-pay-fulfill seamlessly through the technology we design and build. Customers get convenience while merchants save costs and tap into the spending power of the DBS customer base. DBS Bank also gains a new channel to serve and monetise its merchant and customer base. Over the past few months, we are seeing first-hand how DBS FasTrack is changing customer behaviour and generating repeat and new business for merchants. We believe DBS FasTrack is the game changer that will transform how we eat, shop and live. Applied Mesh is humbled and honoured to be part of the adventure.” DBS FasTrack provides a seamless ‘self-service’ online food ordering and cashless payments app solution for businesses while eliminating or drastically shortening customers’ wait time. Therefore, businesses in Singapore can use the online food ordering and cashless payments app solution to enhance their productivity and reduce reliance on manpower. In addition, as most SMEs in the F&B sector conduct their operations on a cash basis, DBS FasTrack effectively helps them make a shift to cashless payments by automating payments via a customised app. Customers can enjoy a seamless in-app checkout process by using a secure card-on-file option or the mobile wallet DBS PayLah!. When drinks outlet Old Tea Hut launched their DBS FasTrack-powered online food ordering and cashless payments app in late May, it saw more than 2,500 downloads in the first two weeks. During the same period, the online food ordering and cashless payments app also provided more than 10% increase in sales for the Marina Bay Link Mall outlet – without additional manpower. After the implementation of DBS FasTrack, Five Star Hainanese Kampung Chicken Rice Restaurant (Five Star Restaurant) saw their takeaway and drive-through order turnaround time reduced by some 80%, as customer orders and cashless payments are now automated by DBS FasTrack . “We welcome the support of business enablers such as banks and telcos as this could help more local SMEs deploy innovative tech solutions. IMDA will continue to work closely with the industry to help SMEs seize greater growth opportunities and enhance business capabilities through the use of smart technology,” said Mr Khoong Hock Yun, Assistant Chief Executive (Development), Infocomm Media Development Authority. To celebrate DBS FasTrack’s official launch, customers will enjoy 10% off ala carte orders via the Koufu app which is available in iOS and Android. Other businesses which plan to implement DBS FasTrack’s online food ordering and cashless payments solution in future include Boon Tong Kee, Li Xin Teochew Fishball, Tiong Bahru Bakery, Wolf Burger, Miam Miam, Qi Ji, Aloha Poke, and Food City @ Midpoint Orchard. Together with existing customers Old Tea Hut, Five Star Restaurant, Old Kim Guan (OKG Express) and Koufu, DBS FasTrack is expected to be implemented in some 150 outlets across Singapore by Q3 2017.

With this in mind, we have converted some of our popular new notes pop-up ATMs so they have now cash deposit functions, alongside our network of some 350 cash deposit machines. Our aim is to provide customers with more innovative and convenient options to help meet their banking needs during this festive season.” Source: PROSPERWITHFENGSHUI.COM POSB new notes pop-up ATMs converted to accept cash in time for Li Chun 2017 Eight POSB new notes pop-up machines will also be converted to accept and dispense cash, and will be available for use in time for Li Chun 2017.

The eAng Bao provides customers with a digital alternative that allows them to carry on the tradition of red packet-giving with their families and friends even if they’re apart. Last year, during the CNY season, some 20% of DBS PayLah! money sending transactions were in the form of eAng Baos. More eAng Baos are also used – up to 3.5 times as much – during festive seasons.

A first in Singapore, the service makes it simpler and faster for SMEs to apply for trade finance services online, while on the go.  SMEs use LCs issued by banks to provide assurance of payment to their overseas suppliers. Before the online service was introduced, for SMEs without an existing credit line for trade finance, they had to visit a bank branch to submit their ad-hoc LC application and it could take up to a week to obtain an LC.  Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said: “This service is yet another first for SMEs in Singapore. Our digital offerings to help SMEs apply for an account, loan products and banker’s guarantee online have been popular. For instance, in the last three months of 2016, about 75% of new accounts opened with DBS were done via the online channel. We will continue to bring essential banking services for SMEs online, to help them save time and effort.” Lim Him Chuan, Group Head of Product Management, Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank said: “Letters of Credit are commonly used trade finance instruments globally, and we are pleased to be able to make the LC application process a truly digital experience for SMEs in Singapore.  SMEs can benefit from a faster turnaround in the application process, enabling them to provide payment confirmation to their suppliers more quickly, and as a result, improve their competitive advantage."" The new service has received positive feedback from SMEs. Ms Sumana Alam, shareholder of Global View Commodity Trading Pte Ltd., said: “The whole procedure is simple and hassle-free. Though I am not in Singapore, I managed to apply for an LC while overseas. I am very pleased with this new service.”  This online Letter of Credit service is among the latest in a slew of initiatives by DBS to bring greater convenience and value to SMEs through digital banking. SMEs can also apply for DBS business accounts , loan products and banker’s guarantees , while on the go.  From now until 31 May 2017, SMEs can enjoy a fee waiver of SGD100 when they apply for an LC online at go.dbs.com/LC.

Chat with POSB via Facebook Messenger – POSB digibank Virtual Assistant,19 Jan 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Chat_with_POSB_via_Facebook_Messenger_POSB_digibank_Virtual_Assistant, Singapore ,"- As part of POSB’s efforts to make day-to-day banking simpler, smarter and faster for its customers, the bank has officially launched an online chat banking on Facebook Messenger. This makes POSB the first bank in Singapore to leverage an artificial intelligence-driven chatbot to enable its customers to bank conversationally on a social messaging platform. POSB first announced its plans for customers to use natural language to chat with POSB from a social messaging app in August 2016. Since then, the bank has been working with US-based Kasisto, a spin-off from SRI International which created the technology behind Siri (Apple's voice assistant), to deliver this service. Kasisto's conversational AI platform, KAI, powers smart bots and virtual assistants with deep banking knowledge. For a start, customers can chat with POSB to enquire about the bank’s products and services via the AI-driven “ POSB digibank Virtual Assistant ”. Customers simply have to visit the POSB Facebook page and go directly to Facebook Messenger to access this service which is available round-the-clock. Since the launch of the service on January 13, all enquiries made via the chat with POSB on Facebook were answered promptly without being re-routed to the bank’s customer centre. The majority of the enquiries centred on the bank’s branch locations and foreign exchange rates. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “As a bank serving close to five million customers in Singapore, we are taking the lead in driving innovation in our digital offerings and providing a seamless customer experience across our platforms. We know that our customers are spending time conversing on their favourite mobile messaging apps, and we are immersing ourselves in the customer journey by making it easier and more convenient for them to engage us. With ‘ POSB digibank Virtual Assistant’ , customers can converse with us as easily as they would with their contacts – no more calls and no more waiting in line just to get a response. Customers can also soon look forward to conducting their banking transactions via this service.” Since September 2016, POSB has spent over 11,000 man hours training the virtual assistant, with actual questions and responses taken from the bank’s customer centre. POSB also set up an annotation team to ensure that responses are kept valid and succinct, and most importantly, be able to meet customer needs. As the “ POSB digibank Virtual Assistant ” understands natural language, it is able to respond in real-time. The POSB virtual assistant also has learning abilities and over time, as more customer questions are answered, it will be able to respond more accurately to enquiries. By 2Q 2017, customers can also look forward to conducting banking transactions such as balance enquiries, fund transfers and card payments through the online chat function via the “ POSB digibank Virtual Assistant ”. Chat banking will also be launched in DBS’ other key markets, with plans to extend this service to other mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat in the future. For more information on “POSB digibank Virtual Assistant”, please visit www.posb.com.sg/chatbot DBS/POSB currently has the largest number of online banking and mobile banking customers in Singapore with over 2.5 million and 1.4 million users respectively, who account for over 1.2 million transactions daily across its digital platforms.

"Save on foreign exchange rates, conversion fees with DBS overseas payments solution for travellers & ecommerce shoppers – Southeast Asia’s first",18 Jan 2017,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Save_on_foreign_exchange_rates_conversion_fees_with_DBS_overseas_payments_solution_for_travellers_and_ecommerce_shoppers_Southeast_Asias_first, Singapore ,"- In a game-changing move, DBS Bank today unveiled its plans to help customers save on their overseas spending by avoiding high foreign exchange (FX) and conversion fees. Starting today, customers with a DBS Visa Debit Card linked to a DBS Multi-Currency Account (MCA) * can use their card to spend overseas in the country’s given local currency ** without any additional charges. This scheme is the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. The savings will be greatest for Singapore customers who shop in overseas-based online stores or who perform credit/debit card payments overseas and choose to pay in SGD therefore avoiding high FX rates and conversion fees.  When they pay in SGD overseas, their payment undergoes a process called “Dynamic Currency Conversion” (DCC), and customers can incur additional merchant charges of between 7% to 15%. In 2016, around 10% of payments by DBS Visa Debit cardholders were overseas transactions made in SGD. Customers who choose to pay in the country’s local currency also get to avoid any additional charges such as FX fees and any other conversion charges. For example, a Singapore traveller who intends to visit the U.S. can change currencies via their DBS MCA account (e.g. from SGD to USD), which offers competitive FX rates. This can be done on-the-go or when FX rates are favourable via DBS mBanking or iBanking. When spending in the U.S., the traveller can simply use their DBS Visa Debit Card to pay for purchases in USD. The amount is then directly deducted from their DBS MCA’s USD balance – no other conversion charges incurred. “With travel and ecommerce expenditure rising rapidly in Singapore, we decided to be on the front foot and introduce a game-changing scheme for customers and the industry. With the DBS MCA and DBS Visa Debit Card, customers can convert their currencies at a competitive FX rate using DBS iBanking or mBanking without needing to make a trip to the money changer. They will also get to skip FX fees and conversion charges for their overseas spends. Our hope is that this will incentivise Singaporeans move towards the security and convenience of cashless payments,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS. DBS’ introduction of the scheme is particularly timely given that it has witnessed close to a 30% increase in foreign currency payment volumes – which includes foreign currency eCommerce and point-of-sales payments – from debit cardholders since 2014. For DBS Visa Debit cardholders in particular, foreign currency payments make up more than 20% of total payments. DBS also sees some SGD560 million in overseas cash withdrawals every year by customers. “Travel is becoming increasingly popular amongst Singaporeans and based on the Consumer Travel Poll jointly conducted by Visa and DBS, more than half of them take two to four leisure trips a year. Visa cardholders are increasingly using their payment cards when they travel and cross border transactions by Singapore debit cardholders is growing close to 15% year-on-year. Today, 95% of Singaporean travellers change money into foreign currencies before they travel and the main reason is because they want to avoid the uncertainty of foreign exchange costs. The introduction of this first in market product in Southeast Asia by DBS and Visa supports Singapore’s move to be truly cashless,” said Ooi Huey Tyng, Visa Country Manager for Singapore and Brunei. To enjoy the benefits of the scheme, customers will need to sign up for both the DBS Multi-Currency Account (MCA) and DBS Visa Debit Card. In addition, the customer’s DBS MCA must be linked to their DBS Visa Debit Card as a primary account. Further details on how to be eligible for the scheme’s benefits are available at www.dbs.com/sg-mca . Launched in 2013, the DBS MCA has rapidly built up a large base and has some 200,000 account holders today. In 2015, DBS made the DBS MCA a standard account for new customers to ensure customers will always have ready access to foreign currency exchange and rates. The DBS MCA is also the only multi-currency account in Singapore that allows exchanges in twelve key foreign currencies (including SGD) *** – by far the most here. In addition, there are some 800,000 DBS Visa Debit cardholders here. The scheme, focused on helping customers who are frequent travellers avoid the hassle of carrying large amounts of cash overseas, is part of DBS’ larger plan to drive cashless payment behaviour and to bring innovation into financial services. This is something the bank is uniquely positioned to do given that it banks most of Singapore and is the nation’s largest credit and debit card provider, with some five million cards in circulation here. Over the last few years, the bank has launched several large-scale and game-changing offerings to help Singaporeans reduce their reliance on cash. This include innovations such as DBS PayLah! (for small merchants and micropayments), DBS FasTrack (for F&B SMEs), POSB Fare Free Friday (for public transport-related transactions); POSB Smart Buddy (for school kids) and more. The bank was also one of the first in Singapore to adopt all three mobile payment platforms – Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay . * The customer’s DBS MCA must be linked to their DBS Visa Debit Card as a primary account ** Available in 12 major currencies including SGD *** SGD, HKD, JPY, THB, AUD, NZD, USD, GBP, EUR, SEK, NOK and CAD [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS/POSB boosts banking footprint with POSB Cash-Point,07 Dec 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_POSB_boosts_banking_footprint_with_POSB_Cash_Point, Singapore ,"- In its drive to extend banking beyond traditional touchpoints, DBS/POSB today announced the addition of some 60 SPH Buzz newsstand outlets to its POSB Cash-Point network. With this expansion, DBS/POSB has effectively increased its POSB Cash-Point locations to around 880 islandwide. Together with DBS/POSB’s network, the bank now has over 2,400 withdrawal touchpoints in Singapore. Introduced in 2013, POSB Cash-Point is a complimentary service that allows customers to withdraw up to SGD200 (in multiples of SGD10) with any item purchase, using a DBS/POSB card linked to their deposit account. POSB Cash-Point is already available at 7-Eleven, Cold Storage, Giant, Guardian, Jasons, Market Place, SingPost and Sheng Siong. (see appendix for further details)  POSB Cash-Point’s retailer mix is specifically focused on key shopping stops (newsstands, supermarkets, convenience stores, health & beauty stores) so customers need not go out of their way to access cash withdrawal services. The service also benefits retail businesses as it helps reduce their outlets’ cash holdings and in turn, the effort involved in handling cash – which includes the counting, transportation and depositing of notes.  Adoption of POSB Cash-Point by customers has seen unabated growth since it was introduced in 2013. The average number of POSB Cash-Point transactions conducted every month in 2016 has risen by 2.5 times since 2014. The average customer today is also starting to withdraw larger amounts per transaction via POSB Cash-Point – around SGD85 per transaction, a 70% increase compared to last year’s SGD50 per transaction. An earlier partnership with SingPost which began in 2011 also allows customers to deposit and withdraw up to SGD5,000 per transaction at its outlets. Some 111,000 cash transactions were conducted at SingPost outlets from January to November 2016, up 13% compared to the same period last year.  Mr. Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group Singapore, DBS Bank said, “We innovate with the aim of providing customers easy, simple and convenient solutions. Even as we pursue our digital agenda, we also understand the value of having a physical touchpoint nearby to fulfil our customers’ cash transaction needs. Our partnership with SPH Buzz is a continuation of a journey we have embarked on to innovatively expand our customer touchpoints islandwide. By leveraging our strong partnerships, we are able to increase our presence at strategic locations to make banking even more convenient for customers on-the-go.”  Mr Chua Wee Phong, SPH's Executive Vice-President of Circulation and Chairman of SPH Buzz said, ""We are very pleased to partner DBS to add banking convenience to the suite of products and services currently available at the SPH Buzz Pod outlets. With the launch of this new service, customers will have the added benefits of making purchases and cash withdrawals simultaneously so long as they own a POSB or DBS card with NETS facility. This expansion of new customer touchpoints is in line with our existing initiatives to improve accessibility and convenience."" DBS/POSB also has the largest base of online banking customers in Singapore with more than 2.5 million iBanking users and 1.3 million mBanking users. DBS PayLah!, a mobile wallet introduced in 2014 to make peer to peer payments easier, now has more than 350,000 registered wallets. In addition, DBS/POSB’s customer mobile activity continues to lead the industry in Singapore and mobile banking accounts for over 60% of the bank’s more than 500,000 daily logins.

"China outpaces London, New York and Silicon Valley to become undisputed global FinTech leader",05 Dec 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/China_outpaces_London_New_York_and_Silicon_Valley_to_become_undisputed_global_FinTech_leader, Singapore ,"- While the UK and the US have jostled to be recognized as leading global FinTech centers, China has leapfrogged ahead to become the undisputed global FinTech hub. The speed, sophistication and scale of development of China’s FinTech ecosystem have been at a level unmatched in more established markets. As banks and financial services institutions in the West look at ways to incrementally innovate, China’s technology leaders are revolutionizing many aspects of financial services. This is according to a collaborative report produced by DBS and EY, The Rise of FinTech in China. The report looks at China’s dynamic and rapidly evolving FinTech ecosystem, and examines the drivers behind its explosive growth. It details the unique characteristics and development profiles of China’s FinTech giants, provides an understanding of the opportunities to scale, and assesses the implications in Asia and internationally. China’s lead is facilitated by the sheer size of the market opportunities present in the financial services ecosystem. At US$10.9 trillion in 2015, China’s GDP already almost equates to the aggregate of the next 10-largest emerging markets. Despite recent market movements, its economic growth continues to outpace almost all other countries. Years of sustained economic growth is swelling the ranks of the middle class, with individuals in this category set to rise from about 150 million to one billion — or 70% of China’s projected population by 2030. This gives rise to a vast consumer base with new-found spending power and unmet financial needs. Underserved by China’s incumbent banking system, consumers and small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly turning to alternative providers for access to payments, credit, investments, insurance and even other non-financial service offerings. Neal Cross, DBS Chief Innovation Officer, says, “The speed at which China’s FinTech landscape has developed is truly remarkable. It’s gotten this far because China’s landscape has operated in a sandbox-like environment conducive for FinTech to thrive — a strong domestic market, coupled with a constant push for innovation and experimentation driven by leading giants, unhindered by international influence. Much of this can be attributed to the favorable government policies and regulations.” “While the country hasn’t received the attention and acclaim of its counterparts in the FinTech arena, its champions are blowing away competition all over the world. It’s only recently that we are starting to see China’s leading FinTech companies take center stage at the global level. This will be an ongoing trend in the coming years and we can expect China’s FinTech ecosystem to have a wide-ranging impact on global FinTech development.” James Lloyd, EY Asia-Pacific FinTech Leader, says, “Chinese FinTech development is primarily characterized by the sheer scale of unmet needs and the opportunities they present. In addition, new providers are typically not constrained by the legacy infrastructure or regulations present in more developed markets. China’s unique mix of rapid urbanization, massive (and underserved) market, e-commerce growth, explosion in online and mobile phone penetration, and customer adoption willingness have created a fertile ground for innovation in commerce, banking and financial services more broadly. “These developments are also worth considering relative to other markets. For consumers and SMEs at least, it is in developing markets where FinTech will likely have the greatest impact. Markets in which the scale of unmet needs and leapfrogging technology combine to create “10x solutions” — that is, solutions that are an order-of-magnitude better than what they replace. This step change in quality, efficiency and user experience is necessary in order to achieve mass adoption — as what we have seen in China,” adds Lloyd. Market properties fueling exponential growth A government-sponsored push into digital penetration, coupled with Chinese consumers’ propensity toward digital adoption, serves as a key driver behind the country’s FinTech boom. There is a disproportionately large presence of tech-savvy millennials or “digital natives” who are open to digital adoption, with less concern over security and providing personal information, as compared with their Western counterparts. For instance, 40% of Chinese consumers use new payments methods compared with 4% in Singapore, while 35% use FinTech to access insurance products compared with 1%–2% in many Southeast Asian markets. There are also significantly higher rates of FinTech participation in wealth management and lending. Chinese consumers are also unique in their high uptake of FinTech products. A large proportion of the population is underbanked; these segments are often unable to access banking and financial services that many in developed markets would take for granted, such as credit cards or simple investment products. Chinese consumers are leapfrogging from cash to digital wallets and from digital wallets to other non-traditional services, often bypassing incumbent providers. In addition, Chinese FinTechs have a distinct efficiency and business flexibility coupled with a strong willingness and ability to adapt quickly — attributes other global and regional players can learn from. FinTech offerings such as Alipay developed as a response to a gap in the market for direct and trustworthy e-payment channels. From there, Ant Financial (the Alibaba financial affiliate which operates Alipay) has expanded into investment products, lending, credit scoring, insurance and so on. Chinese FinTech products are also often highly intuitive and convenient, and platforms and apps soon become indispensable — aiding in the digital adoption process. Future of Chinese FinTech and the global impact China will likely continue to lead global FinTech development in the coming years. Domestically, the push and pull factors are clearly in place to catalyze the establishment of a leading digital finance sector increasingly expanding beyond the cities into the countryside. On the push side, capital investment is soaring and the market bolstered by substantial government support for innovation. On the pull side, demand is being driven by underserved SMEs and tech-savvy, often unbanked, consumers keen to access financial services on their mobile phones. Overseas, Chinese FinTech firms will play an increasingly important role in global collaborations driving technological innovation — via partnerships, investments and acquisitions. This puts Southeast Asia-based FinTechs and start-ups in a favorable position to collaborate. EY’s Lloyd says, “We anticipate a mutually beneficial relationship wherein regional players can gain access to funding and expanded customer bases by partnering with Chinese FinTechs, with a view to further developing their coverage and offerings. A key challenge for Chinese FinTechs as they seek to internationalize, however, will be in attempting to replicate their domestic ecosystems overseas; this is where local FinTechs (and, indeed, established financial services providers) can cooperate — or compete.” View the report online at https://www.dbsinsights.com/china/chinas-fintechs-disrupt-world .

This includes embarking on a comprehensive and holistic mission to changing the culture and mindset of staff, re-architecting the bank's technology infrastructure, and leveraging Big Data, biometrics and artificial intelligence to reimagine banking. The bank has also been actively engaging the FinTech ecosystem with programmes such as the DBS HotSpot, the first pre-accelerator programme created and wholly-run by an Asian bank. Over 40 start-ups were accelerated as part of the programme, which will now be housed at DAX. In addition, the bank has also run a number of hackathons to discover new solutions and services to unlock further value in the financial services space. Through the DBS Foundation, the bank has supported and nurtured over 100 social enterprises. Said Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Bank: “DBS Asia X underscores DBS’ ongoing commitment to shaping the future of banking and embracing the future of work. It is a purpose built facility for DBS employees from all over the region to come together, design and develop iconic customer journeys and work in close collaboration with start-ups and the broader FinTech community. We look towards helping to further Singapore's Smart Nation agenda as we transform DBS into a 22,000 person start-up. "" Said Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director, MAS: “The opening of DBS Asia X today is a new milestone in DBS’ innovation journey.  With the building up of its innovation capabilities at DBS Asia X, and the development and delivery of innovative solutions across a wide range of business areas, DBS Asia X will play an important role in bringing DBS’ strategic priorities in the area of technology and innovation to fruition.  It will also increase DBS’ contribution to the development of Singapore’s FinTech ecosystem, which is an important area of focus for Singapore. We believe that innovation-led growth will drive our next phase of development towards a Smart Financial Centre.” Said Neal Cross, Chief Innovation Officer, DBS Bank: “As a crucial component of our digital agenda, we are making good headway in creating a “FinTech-like” workforce that is consumed with disrupting and redesigning the customer experience. With our new innovation facility, we will provide yet another agile space to catalyse greater cross-functional collaboration and experimentation in our people to reimagine banking and create joyful customer experiences.” DBS is one of the first banks in the region to adopt human-centred design thinking. This year, more than 5,000 DBS employees were exposed to agile methodology and other digital concepts through customer journey workshops and hackathons held across the region. The bank has ran over 1,000 experiments and the bank’s senior managers are each responsible for owning for at least one customer journey, to collectively transform the overall DBS experience for customers and employees alike. DBS has collaborated with FinTechs to create state-of-the-art customer offerings. For example, digibank, India’s first mobile-only bank, comprises artificial intelligence technology from US-based Kasisto, an intelligent budget optimiser from Singapore-based Moneythor and a soft token solution by Singapore-based V-Key. DBS aims to co-locate DBS employees from around the region in the new facility as it embraces a new way of working and develops iconic customer journeys. At DAX, the bank will also run numerous programmes to fuel innovation. This includes: Establishing the FinTech Foundry, a start-up engagement initiative, where FinTechs will be encouraged to partner with DBS staff to prototype ideas, as well as develop mobile and web banking solutions via an eight to 12-week programme. The initial focus will be on delivering customer-centric concepts related to insurance, deposits, payments, wealth management and cybersecurity. This programme will leverage DBS’ tech specialists, user experience designers, ethnographic specialists and data scientists.  Regular API hackathons which will involve start-ups, SMEs and Social Enterprises interested in finding ways to innovate and seamlessly integrate banking into the lives of customers and the communities we serve.

DBS to acquire ANZ wealth management and retail banking business in five markets | 繁體,31 Oct 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_acquire_ANZ_wealth_management_and_retail_banking_business_in_five_markets, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank Ltd (DBS) announced today that it has agreed to acquire the wealth management and retail banking business of ANZ in five markets for approximately SGD 110 million 1 above book value. The portfolio of businesses being acquired is in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Indonesia, representing total deposits of SGD 17 billion, loans of SGD 11 billion, investment AUM of SGD 6.5 billion and total revenue of SGD 825 million for FY2016. They serve about 1.3 million customers, of which over 100,000 are affluent/ private wealth customers and 1.2 million are retail customers. This transaction makes strategic sense for the following reasons: Cements DBS’ position as a leading wealth manager in Asia Enables rapid scale-up of digital strategy in Indonesia and Taiwan Creates financial value – ROE and earnings accretive one year after completion Over the past five years, DBS has consistently grown its wealth management business and is today among the top five private banks in Asia. With the acquisition, DBS will add SGD 23 billion in wealth AUM  to its books, with high net worth clients accounting for SGD 6 billion. This will take DBS’ high net worth AUM and total wealth AUM to SGD 115 billion and SGD 182 billion respectively. The acquisition will also add a large customer franchise to DBS in Indonesia and Taiwan, which are key markets for the bank. In Indonesia, DBS will gain about 410,000 customers, effectively increasing its base by six times. In Taiwan, DBS will add around 530,000 customers, expanding its base by 2.5 times. A significant portion of these are credit card customers. With a larger scale in both markets, the bank will be able to fast-track the build-out of its digital strategy. Sebastian Paredes, CEO of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “Hong Kong is the anchor of our Greater China business. This transaction will allow our Hong Kong wealth management business to expand by some HK$39 billion in AUM and affirms our long-term commitment to further entrenching our position as a leading wealth manager in Hong Kong.” DBS expects the transaction to create significant value for the bank. With its scale in the five markets, it will be able to bolt on the ANZ business to its existing platform, and benefit from efficiencies especially in technology and branch distribution. The transaction is expected to be ROE and earnings accretive one year after completion. Said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management of DBS, “Over the years, DBS has made significant strides in the wealth business, and recently became the first Singapore and Asian bank to break into the top five private banks in Asia-Pacific. This acquisition will further cement our leadership position. It also gives ANZ’s wealth customers access to more tailored solutions and a full suite of universal banking products supported by Asian insights, research and investment advice. At the same time, the transaction provides us with a significant consumer platform in Indonesia and Taiwan that will enable us to more quickly build out our digital agenda.” Said David Hisco, ANZ Group Executive Asia Retail and Wealth, “Having built up a strong retail banking and wealth management franchise in Asia over the years, it was important for us to find a buyer that could take the business to the next level for customers. DBS is the best choice – its Singapore pedigree, strong Asian footprint, commitment to Asia and financial strength were key for us. This transaction represents a great opportunity for our customers and the majority of our staff in the region to fully benefit from a progressive and dynamic bank.” Transaction Terms and Funding The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on DBS’ capital position, earnings or net asset value per share this year. The acquisition of the businesses in each jurisdiction is independent of each other. Subject to obtaining regulatory approvals, the transaction is anticipated to be completed progressively from 2Q2017 onwards, and the target is for full completion in all markets by early 2018. 1 Assumes AUD 1= SGD 1 to align press communications by both parties.

DBS third-quarter earnings at SGD 1.07 Billion | 繁體,31 Oct 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_third_quarter_earnings_at_SGD_1_07_Billion," Singapore, Regional, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan ","- DBS Group reported net profit of SGD 1.07 billion for third quarter 2016, little changed from a year ago. An 8% rise in total income to SGD 2.93 billion as well as cost containment resulted in a 19% increase in profit before allowances to a record SGD 1.73 billion. The strong operating results provided substantial headroom for higher general allowances to be taken as a prudent measure. For the nine months, DBS achieved net profit of SGD 3.33 billion. Excluding one-time items a year ago, it was also little changed. Total income rose 7% to SGD 8.71 billion with both net interest and non-interest income reaching new highs. The cost-income ratio improved from 45% to 43% as past investments to digitise the bank as well as cost management initiatives yielded productivity gains. The resulting 11% increase in profit before allowances to SGD 4.96 billion was offset by a doubling in total allowances. Return on equity was at 10.7%. The NPL rate rose moderately from the previous quarter to 1.3% as a previously-disclosed weak exposure in oil and gas support services was recognised as an NPL during the quarter. The NPL is well-collateralised with losses expected to be minimal. Allowance coverage was at 100% and at 204% if collateral was considered. The third-quarter and nine-month results underscored the earnings resilience of the DBS franchise as it continued to capture opportunities across multiple business lines while recognising loan impairment promptly and maintaining a healthy balance sheet in challenging operating conditions. Third-quarter total income up 8% from a year ago Compared to a year ago, net interest income was little changed at SGD 1.82 billion. Net interest margin was stable at 1.77%. Loans rose 5% in constant-currency terms to SGD 290 billion. An 8% increase in non-trade loans from regional corporates as well as market share gains in Singapore housing loans was partially offset by a 14% decline in trade loans. Non-interest income grew 24% to SGD 1.11 billion. Net fee income rose 19% to SGD 614 million from broad-based growth. It was led by a 47% increase in wealth management fees to a new high of SGD 201 million from stronger bancassurance income. Investment banking fees rose 74% to SGD 54 million from higher equity market and fixed income fees as well as higher advisory activities. Card fees increased 15% to SGD 123 million as credit and debit card transactions in Singapore continued to rise. Transaction services fees were 11% higher at SGD 147 million from growth in cash management fees. Other non-interest income increased 32% to SGD 500 million from higher trading income and gains on investment securities. Income from treasury customer sales was stable at SGD 308 million. Expenses declined 5% to SGD 1.20 billion due to lower operating expenses as well as productivity gains. While business volumes grew, staff costs were little changed at SGD 672 million as bonus accruals declined. A slight increase in full-time employees over the past 12 months was due to the insourcing of certain technology functions as part of strategic cost management efforts; underlying staff numbers were little changed. Profit before allowances rose 19% to SGD 1.73 billion. Third-quarter results stable from the previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, net profit was 2% higher. Total income was around the strong level of the previous quarter.  A decline in expenses was offset by an increase in total allowances as general allowances were taken. Net interest income was 1% lower. Net interest margin declined 10 basis points to 1.77% in line with lower Singapore-dollar interest rates and as liquidity buffers were built up in anticipation of US money market reform and central bank actions. Loans rose 2% from corporate loans and Singapore housing loans. Trade loans were little changed. Non-interest income rose 3%. Fee income was 2% lower as investment banking fees fell 35% from a high base in the previous quarter. The decline was offset by higher wealth management and card fees. Other non-interest income grew 9% from an increase in trading income and gains on fixed assets. Expenses were 7% lower due partly to non-recurring expenses in the second quarter as well as lower bonus accruals. Profit before allowances was 6% higher. Nine-month total income rises to new high For the nine months, total income rose 7% to a new high of SGD 8.71 billion. With expenses rising less quickly than income as a result of productivity gains, profit before allowances grew 11%. Net profit was little changed due to a doubling of total allowances. Net interest income rose 4% to SGD 5.48 billion. The increase was due to a nine basis point improvement in net interest margin to 1.83% in line with higher average Singapore-dollar interest rates. Loans grew 5% in constant-currency terms. Non-interest income grew 11% to SGD 3.23 billion. Net fee income rose 9% to SGD 1.82 billion, led by double-digit growth in wealth management, cards and investment banking. Other non-interest income was 14% higher at SGD 1.42 billion as trading income and gains from investment securities rose. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income grew 21% to SGD 3.20 billion, led by income from bancassurance, loans and deposits. Income from the Wealth Management customer segment increased 16% to SGD 1.26 billion as assets under management grew 11% to SGD 159 billion, putting DBS among the top five banks in the Asia-Pacific. Institutional Banking income was little changed at SGD 3.96 billion. Growth in income from cash management, capital markets and loan activities was offset by declines in trade and treasury customer sales due to uncertainty related to China and the renminbi. Treasury income was 3% lower at SGD 865 million. Expenses rose 2% to SGD 3.75 billion, resulting in an improvement in the cost-income ratio from 45% to 43%. Profit before allowances grew 11% to SGD 4.96 billion. Asset quality continues to be sound The non-performing loan rate rose from 1.1% in the previous quarter to 1.3%. The increase was due largely to the recognition of a well-collateralised exposure in oil and gas support services. For the third quarter, general allowances of SGD 169 million were taken as a prudent measure, compared with SGD 35 million a year ago. Specific allowances for credit exposures amounted to SGD 261 million as specific allowances for loans rose to 30 basis points compared to 20 basis points a year ago. For the nine months, total allowances doubled to SGD 972 million due to higher specific allowances for credit exposures. A significant part of the increase in specific allowances was due to Swiber in the second quarter. Allowance coverage was at 100% and at 204% if collateral was considered. Liquidity and capital remain strong Higher liquidity buffers were maintained as a precautionary measure. Deposits rose 5% during the quarter to SGD 324 billion. The loan-deposit ratio declined from 92% in the previous quarter to 89%. The liquidity coverage ratio for the third quarter was 115%, above the final regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the regulatory requirement due in 2018. Capital remained strong. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was at 14.4%. The leverage ratio of 7.8% was more than twice the minimum 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “The resilience of our earnings and balance sheet in challenging operating conditions this year underscores the quality of our franchise. Broad-based growth has resulted in a consistently strong year-on-year increase in total income over the three quarters. Investments to digitise the bank and efforts to manage costs are galvanising into faster productivity gains. All this has enabled us to maintain earnings stability and balance sheet strength while taking higher allowance charges. We will continue to support customers and assiduously manage risks in order to deliver steady financial performance for shareholders.”  [End]  About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS Private Bank breaks into top 5 in Asia-Pacific,27 Oct 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Private_Bank_breaks_into_top_5_in_Asia_Pacific, Singapore ,"- DBS is now the fifth largest private bank in Asia-Pacific by assets under management (AUM), according to the latest study by Private Banker International, a leading journal for the global wealth industry, in its annual “PBI Top 20 Asia-Pacific Assets Under Management (AUM) Rankings”. The bank broke into the top 5 in Asia-Pacific, after jumping three spots from its No. 8 placing in last year’s rankings. The growth of DBS’ wealth management franchise is robust, fuelled by the organic growth of emerging Asian new wealth and also by the successful execution of its wealth continuum. After the successful acquisition of Société Générale Private Banking Asia in 2014, DBS Private Bank continued to grow from strength to strength. It has also consistently achieved growth of about 20% annually since 2010. As of June 2016, DBS’ high net worth assets under management (HNWIs with more than SGD1.5 million each in investible assets) and assets under management for all wealth customers stand at SGD104 billion and SGD151 billion respectively. Said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management at DBS Bank, “We are delighted to be ranked among the top five in Asia and to represent Singapore in the rankings. Despite facing a challenging volatile market, our wealth business remains robust. We are committed to growing our wealth business and as the safest bank in Asia, amid current market conditions, we are in prime position to further capture market share.” As we execute against our strategy to achieve our ambition of becoming the wealth manager of choice, we will continue to focus on enhancing the delivery of our financial and banking capabilities to our clients. This includes our initiatives to deliver the next generation client experience in providing advice and our latest enhancements made to our best-in-class digital wealth platform, DBS iWealth.” Said John Schaffer, Correspondent at Private Banker International, “DBS has shown significant promise by bolstering its ranking from last year’s position of 8th (USD73 billion) to 5th (USD79 billion). This comes in spite of a slowdown of AUM figures for private banks in APAC. DBS has bucked the trend this year, which saw some top-tier banks’ AUM performance dip or become stagnant. DBS’ performance reflects the bank’s focus on client centricity, as well as its focus on digital banking innovation - which is particularly pertinent for private banking clients in APAC.” Just this week, DBS also made a number of key enhancements to its wealth portal, iWealth. The new and improved DBS iWealth provides clients with all-in-one access via a single platform to conduct their banking transactions, manage their wealth and also trade. The enhancements made to DBS iWealth were implemented after a number of focus groups conducted with its clients, who asked for products and services that are relevant to their investment needs and risk appetite, information and execution that are delivered at speed, and simple processes. The enhanced wealth platform empowers clients with quick and intuitive access to services, product information and research. Insights and analysis can be customised according to clients’ preferences and holdings. Equities and funds trading have been incorporated into the platform, enhancing the range of asset classes that are available online. Some of the key features of DBS iWealth include: • Single dashboard for up-to-date view of a client’s banking, trading and wealth management portfolio • Clients can trade stocks in seven key markets and stay on top of trends with customised charting tools, market analysis, stock search and filters • “Online Funds Trading” provides clients with quick access to over 400 funds, as well as fund information, research data and expert analysis • Insights from research based on clients’ preferences and holdings • Timely notifications and price alerts for clients to keep track of their portfolio Said Tan, “The digital revolution has changed the way our clients live, work and play, and we are focused on always being relevant to our clients. Client experience and usability are key for us, and we have taken bold steps to enhance the delivery of financial and banking capabilities, giving our clients a faster, smarter and more personalised way to manage their wealth.” DBS iWealth will also be available on the mobile platform in early 2017.

POSB runs successful trial of world’s first in-school wearable tech savings & payments programme – “POSB Smart Buddy”,20 Oct 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_RUNS_SUCCESSFUL_TRIAL_OF_WORLDS_FIRST_IN_SCHOOL_WEARABLE_TECH_SAVINGS_AND_PAYMENTS_PROGRAMME_POSB_SMART_BUDDY, Singapore ,"- POSB today announced the successful trial run of a global first – the POSB Smart Buddy programme. The ground-breaking programme – the first of its kind – creates a contactless payments ecosystem within the school to help cultivate sensible savings and spending habits among young students in an interactive, engaging manner. Its accompanying mobile app allows parents to remotely manage their children’s spending and savings, while empowering students to monitor their own finances. The POSB Smart Buddy programme uses portable and wearable devices such as a watch or a student card and modifies them, so they have contactless payment capabilities. The programme also comes with a mobile app which tracks their expenses and savings in real-time, and allows parents to pre-set daily allowances for students. From July this year onwards, some 130 students from Anchor Green Primary School received a customised POSB watch, while some 60 students from St. Joseph’s Institution Junior (SJIJ) tested their modified student concession card. Students were able to use these items to make contactless purchases in their school canteen or bookstore.  In Anchor Green Primary, the schools’ canteen and bookstore vendors were set up with contactless terminals with which students could use their POSB Smart Buddy watches to make purchases. A kiosk was also set up at the school canteen, allowing students to scan their watches so they can instantly check on their remaining allowance for the day. Students who are given partial access to the accompanying app by parents can also check on their savings and spending balances. In addition, the POSB Smart Buddy watch also doubles as a fitness tracker, helping the child track their steps and calories burnt for the day.  Benefits of the POSB Smart Buddy programme include:  1) Hands-on learning of financial management at an early age : The programme’s uniqueness lies in its ability to provide young students with a real-world and hands-on interactive learning tool that helps them understand the basics of financial management. Parents can give their child partial access to the app, where their child can view their own savings and spending patterns in real-time. Finally, the child can also choose to spend part of their allowance on the POSB National School Savings Campaign’s Smiley Stamps at their school bookstore. Such purchases will be automatically logged as “savings”.  E. Foo, 7 years old, who is taking part in the programme trial at SJI Junior said, “Buying items with my student card is very fun and easy. If I need anything from the canteen and bookstore, I can just use my card to pay. I especially like buying Smiley Stamps and seeing my savings build up day by day!”  2) Greater convenience for parents, coupled with security : Using the programme's app, parents can link their savings account with the app and effectively manage their child’s spending at school by setting a daily allowance limit in advance. They can also view their child’s expenses and savings in real-time via the accompanying app, as well as increase their child’s daily allowance limit instantly – no more rushing to school to hand their child emergency spending money. In addition, parents can choose to automatically transfer the accumulated savings into their child’s POSBkids account. If the child loses their watch or card, parents can remotely disable the devices in an instant.  Ms. S.K. Kok, whose sons participated in the programme, appreciated the ease of using the app, “It’s just so simple and convenient. I used to have to collect coins to ensure my children have their allowance for the day but with POSB Smart Buddy's app, I simply key in the allowance to be allocated to them that day. I also share with my sons the savings they’ve managed to accumulate for the week and encourage them to save more.”  3) Encourage familiarity and experimentation with wearable tech and contactless payments :  The POSB Smart Buddy programme takes an innovative approach to getting students familiarised with relatively sophisticated concepts such as wearable tech and contactless payments at a young age. Furthermore, the payments ecosystem set up within the school provides an environment where students are introduced to how such technology works in an intuitive manner. The programme is very much in line with Singapore’s vision of becoming a Smart Nation, to harness data and technology to enhance our lives.  Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “The introduction of the POSB Smart Buddy programme – a global first – carries on a long and proud POSB tradition of introducing innovative savings initiatives to generations of Singaporeans. From creating a nationwide savings programme for students, to being the first to provide a rewards programme for national servicemen, our aim as Singapore’s oldest and most loved bank is to always remain at the forefront of providing pioneering financial solutions that cater to the evolving needs of Singaporeans.”  “The most exciting part of POSB Smart Buddy is the level of enthusiasm and creativity it has sparked among the students. We had some young students present us with a long list of ideas for customising and improving the watch/card and the app. POSB Smart Buddy is highly adaptable and has a great number of potential applications. Future iterations may include the ability to track diets, pay for transport charges, GPS tracking for security purposes, making the programme even more holistic. The positive feedback we’ve received on POSB Smart Buddy has been tremendous and look forward to rolling it out to even more schools in future as part of the POSB National School Savings Campaign.”  Mr. Tan Kok Yam, Head of Smart Nation Programme Office, said, “We are very encouraged by the collaboration between POSB and schools. This is a great example of how a good idea can arise organically, be tested and refined by users, with the eventual aim of being put to practical use. In this case, using wearable technologies, parents can be given greater convenience and peace of mind, while kids can learn about financial management and the virtue of thriftiness.”  Feedback from students and parents who took part in the programme was roundly positive, with most expressing interest in continuing participation. Among the highlights cited by parents were the ability to increase the daily allowance limit of their child in case of emergency, and to monitor their child’s spending and savings in real-time.  POSB Smart Buddy is also part of a ground-up effort by the bank to drive cashless payment behaviour in Singapore – something the bank is uniquely positioned to do given that it banks most of Singapore. POSB does so by providing Singaporeans with an entire ecosystem of options to meet various payment needs and preferences. POSB/DBS was one of the first in Singapore to adopt all three mobile payment platforms – Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay, and was the first bank in Singapore to launch a mobile wallet DBS PayLah!.  For schools who wish to find out more about the POSB Smart Buddy programme, please email consumerdeposits@dbs.com .  APPENDIX  Additional quotes Mr. Chong Chee Wee, Subject Head of Environmental Education at Anchor Green Primary said, “We believe the programme is beneficial as it allows the students to learn the importance of managing their finances wisely in a new and fun way. It also helps to cultivate the value of thrift and financial literacy at a young age.”  Ms. Julie Oaw, Canteen Operator at Anchor Green Primary said, “One thing I like about the programme is that I can easily monitor my sales and what’s more my sales proceeds are automatically transferred to my savings account the very next day.”  A Primary 4 student who had taken part in the trial at Anchor Green Primary said, “I like to use the POSB wearable band because it’s very useful.  You don’t have to take out your wallet every time you want to pay for your meals and the queue is so much faster at the school canteen.” [End] About POSB A part of the DBS Group, POSB is the largest and oldest local bank in Singapore with over 4 million customers.

DBS introduces a revolutionary new way for corporate customers to bank,10 Oct 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_introduces_a_revolutionary_new_way_for_corporate_customers_to_bank, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank continues to be at the forefront of digital innovation with the new DBS IDEAL Mobile feature that eliminates physical tokens for corporate transactions. Available to both Apple and Android users, DBS is the first Asian bank to offer this integrated service on one mobile platform. The novel digital token feature will make banking on the go simpler and more convenient for corporate treasurers and small business owners. Currently, corporate treasurers often have to carry several security tokens to conduct their business banking, with some having up to six physical tokens with them at any one time. To access the digital token, existing DBS IDEAL users simply need to download or update the DBS IDEAL Mobile app from the Apple or Google Play store on their phones. As the digital token is integrated into the user’s phone, it is secure, available 24/7 and easier to use. Specifically for iPhone users, the digital token utilises the user’s fingerprint to ensure identity confirmation and conduct secure online transactions. Android users will continue to key in their PIN to carry out transactions. “As a bank that is shaping the future of banking, we want to provide an easy, more convenient and secure solution to our corporate customers. The new digital token feature on DBS IDEAL Mobile is a great example of how we are leveraging technology to help create a more intuitive and seamless banking experience for them,” said John Laurens, Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank.

DBS reinvents joyful banking with SPARKS mini series | 繁體,28 Sep 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_REINVENTS_JOYFUL_BANKING_WITH_SPARKS_MINI_SERIES, Hong Kong ,"- With the overwhelming success of DBS’ industry-first Sparks mini-series, which launched earlier this year with three episodes that were viewed more than 12 million times, DBS continues to reinvent and disrupt the industry with the latest Sparks installment in what is the first and longest-running mini-series by a bank about banking and bankers. Inspired by a true story, Sparks reflects DBS’ commitment of “Making banking joyful” and helping customers “Live more, bank less”. Sparks tells the story of a group of dynamic young DBS bankers as they challenge the status quo to go above and beyond when solving customers’ challenges. This is the commitment DBS brings to integrating banking seamlessly with customers’ everyday lives, and to go the extra mile so they can achieve their dreams and get more out of life. Through this mini-series, DBS hopes to convey the true meaning of banking, and to challenge the perception that banking is only about transactions. Glendy Chu, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “As DBS Hong Kong continues to embrace innovation and digital banking, our branding and marketing strategy reflects this creativity in sparking conversations and meaningful experiences. Sparks is one of the ways we are disrupting the industry with digitally oriented content marketing. Sparks speaks to our customers in a relatable manner, and captures that sense of mission, of being easy to deal with and of being trustworthy, that characterises the way DBS works.” Royce Teo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group and Wealth Management, Hong Kong, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “At DBS Hong Kong, the customer journey doesn't end with a transaction. It spans the entire customer lifetime, and at every step of the way. The key to successful relationships is to get to know our customers and to treat everyone as an individual. This also helps the entire DBS team feel connected to the customer, no matter what their job. The customer has emotional and rational needs and desires. People don’t bank to transact. They bank because they want to get the most out of life.” The mini-series can be viewed at www.dbs.com/sparks as well as on Facebook and YouTube. In Hong Kong, it is supported by a TVC and an interactive digital campaign. We will leverage traditional media and the TVC to reach multi-screen users and engage them via digital channels. From today, the public is also invited to play our “Watch to Win” game for a chance to win fantastic prizes. Sparks is directed by renowned director David Tsui and produced by DBS. Shot on location in Hong Kong, including at various DBS Hong Kong premises, the mini-series follows a group of dynamic DBS bankers. They include Claire Lee, played by Hong Kong model Jamie Ha, and her colleague and love interest, a cocky Oxford-educated Jasper Wu, portrayed by singer James Yang. Their superiors are played by Adrian Pang, a veteran actor from Singapore, and actress Maeve Flood-Murphy. Also playing DBS bankers are Nick English, an actor and martial artist, and Aanchal Wadhwani, a fashion designer cum photographer and actress. Other prominent actors also feature in the cast, including Hong Kong actor Michael Wong and US-born model Samantha Staynings. As a bank born and bred in Asia, DBS believes in the importance of establishing relationships that provide continuity and stability in an evolving business environment. This is reflected in the long-standing recognition of DBS’ leadership in Hong Kong and across the region and globally. DBS was recently named “World’s Best Digital Bank” by Euromoney. The bank was conferred “Asia’s Best Bank” by The Banker and Euromoney, and “Asian Bank of the Year” by IFR Asia. The bank has also been named “Safest Bank in Asia” by Global Finance for eight consecutive years from 2009 to 2016.

DBS named Asia’s safest bank for the 8th consecutive year | 繁體,20 Sep 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_Asias_safest_bank_for_the_8th_consecutive_year," Singapore, Hong Kong ","- DBS Bank announced today that it has been named “Safest Bank in Asia” for the eighth consecutive year by New York-based trade publication Global Finance. DBS is third on the list of the global safest commercial banks and 12th safest bank globally. “Asian banks put in a strong showing in the top 20, led by Singapore’s DBS Bank at number 12,” said Global Finance publisher and editorial director Joseph D. Giarraputo. Within Asia itself, the Singapore banks dominate the list, with DBS topping the ranking. “In the past year, Asia has seen landmark political shifts at a time of economic uncertainty. Our ranking of the Safest Banks in the region showcases banks that have built solid foundations—offering security and stability in this rapidly changing environment—and provides a consistent tool for comparing institutional strength within the region,” said Giarraputo. “With tighter regulations, now more than ever, corporate clients demand financial services they can trust.” Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Bank said, “DBS is honoured to be consistently recognised as the safest bank in Asia.  The global economy this year has been marked by more pronounced economic uncertainty and volatility.  Despite the challenging operating environment, the bank’s first-half net profit reached a record high, which is a testament to the strength and resilience of the franchise.” DBS reported record core net profit of SGD 2.25 billion for the first half of 2016. The bank’s in-depth knowledge of Asian markets, innovative products, high credit ratings and strong balance sheet have positioned the bank well to grow and capture opportunities in the region. Since 1992, the Global Finance ranking has been a recognised standard of creditworthiness for the financial world. The banks were selected through an evaluation of long-term credit ratings – from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings – and total assets of the 500 largest banks worldwide.

DBS leverages big data analytics to reduce trade anomalies,01 Sep 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_leverages_big_data_analytics_to_reduce_trade_anomalies, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank, which is shaping the future of banking, continues to blaze a path in the industry, including in the traditionally paper-based trade finance business. The bank said today that working in partnership with A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I 2 R), Singapore’s largest ICT research institute, and Cloudera, the leading provider of a data management and analytics platform built on the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, it has established a groundbreaking programme that will enable it to leverage big data technology to detect abnormal transaction activities in the trade finance space. Such a programme is a first for a Singapore bank. Choong Yang Ping, Managing Director, Technology and Operations, DBS Bank said, “With global trade set to grow, and increased regulatory demands on anti money-laundering and fraud prevention, we believe in taking a proactive approach in enhancing our current risk management processes. This trade alerts programme has helped the bank create a more robust platform to detect trade anomalies. The bank is now able to use the big data to manage the overall transactional trends more effectively. ” Prof. Dim-Lee Kwong, Executive Director, A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I 2 R) said, “Our long-standing partnership with DBS highlights the importance of leveraging big data technology to build more robust data ecosystems for the financial industry and potentially help prevent financial crimes.” While trade finance is a burgeoning business, it remains a paper-intensive industry involving manual processes. Traditionally, trade finance controls have also centred on the bank’s understanding of its clients, the nature of the transaction, documentary financing and credit monitoring. With this new trade alerts initiative, DBS is able to detect fraud anomalies through transactional trends instead of relying on checks on singular transactions. The trade alerts programme was launched in April 2016 and these alerts are currently detected at the transaction level; over time, DBS intends to extend this to a customer portfolio view in real time. The trade alerts capability covers 13 locations across DBS Group. It was made possible with the partnership with Cloudera, using big data infrastructure first deployed 12 months ago. “We are pleased to partner with DBS, a very forward thinking financial institution in Asia,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer and co-founder of Cloudera. “The finance industry is going digital and financial services companies like DBS are harnessing data to make informed decisions, identify trends and to stay ahead of competition. At the same time, financial services businesses face tremendous regulatory pressure from authorities to recognise and prevent fraud, to comply with international law and to reduce risks. Cloudera offers a fully secured and governed enterprise data platform that delivers more flexibility, more cost control and more value for these workloads than legacy systems. It is ideal for the needs and requirements of the financial service business. This is why the world’s leading financial service companies choose to work with Cloudera.” Ng Peng Khim, Head of Institutional Banking Group Technology, Digital Innovation & Data Management, DBS Bank said, “DBS has invested in technology and people over the past five years and will continue to do so going forward. The use of big data technologies using open source programming and integrated analytics enables us to glean stronger insights for decision-making purposes.”  [END]  About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS’ Neal Cross recognised as the most disruptive Chief Innovation Officer globally,30 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Neal_Cross_recognised_as_the_most_disruptive_Chief_Innovation_Officer_globally, Singapore ,"- A panel which consists of prominent business innovators including Apple co-Founder Steve Wozniak and Virgin Group Founder, Sir Richard Branson, has judged DBS’ Chief Innovation Officer, Neal Cross, as the most disruptive Chief Innovation Officer (CIO)/ Chief Technology Officer (CTO) globally. In a recent Talent Unleashed competition, which recognises exceptional individuals and organisations who are unleashing technology in the workplace and community, Cross edged out competitors from across UK, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand to be recognised as the most disruptive CIO.

Led by DBS CEO Piyush Gupta and his senior leadership team, together with Cross and DBS employees from virtually every part of the organisation, the bank has made re-imagining banking a significant part of its agenda.

In so doing, it pipped BBVA, Citi and ING to this highly coveted award. Said Gupta: “At DBS, we have spent the last three years intently pursuing a digital agenda. At the heart of this is our belief that with the rapid changes upon our industry, we need to transform the bank, and to turn it into a 22,000-person fintech. To be globally recognised at an organisational level by Euromoney, and now again as having the most disruptive CIO, is validation that our digital transformation is seen as being among the best in the world.” In recent years, DBS has undertaken an extensive innovation programme that includes the introduction of lean start-up thinking and human-centred design methodologies. In 2015, DBS also enhanced its engagement with the start-up community with the launch of DBS HotSpot, a pre-accelerator programme for fintech, social enterprises and digital start-ups to encourage entrepreneurialism.

Said Cross: “To be recognised at the global level is truly a great honour both for my team and myself. As a bank, DBS has been constantly driving innovation to re-imagine how banking can be done, so that customers can live more and do the things they want to do. We are honoured that the international community recognises these efforts.” The other winners at Talent Unleashed included: - ODOCS as Best Start-Up – Social Impact - CleverTar as Best Start-Up – Tech Innovation - TherapyBox as Best Digital SME - ResApp Health for Best Tech IPO/Venture Capital Raising The five winners will travel to Silicon Valley for an exclusive tour of some of the world’s leading technology companies and receive individual time with Wozniak to be guided on their continued innovation journey.

The Hong Kong - ASEAN Summit 2016 is the third such annual event and brought together key representatives from Consulates General and trade associations, as well as entrepreneurs from Asian countries, Hong Kong's political and financial leaders, and experts in economic research. The event explored ways for local Hong Kong enterprises to further align with the ""going out"" policy, the prospects for RMB internationalisation in the context of Sino-US relations, and the corresponding strategies that should be adopted by enterprises. The Honourable Gregory So Kam-leung, GBS, JP, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, delivered the luncheon keynote speech, in which he noted how the Hong Kong government assists companies interested in expanding their presence globally and in ASEAN markets along the routes of the Belt and Road initiative.

DBS partners with Pivotal to accelerate innovation for customers,29 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_partners_with_Pivotal_to_accelerate_innovation_for_customers, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced it is stepping up its digital transformation journey and accelerating innovation for customers through a collaboration with Pivotal®, the company accelerating digital transformation for enterprises. DBS is the first bank in Southeast Asia to run cloud native applications on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, progressing from traditional legacy systems to a highly scalable and flexible environment. Through the adoption of Pivotal’s leading modern cloud platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, DBS will have the foundation to innovate at a speed and velocity primarily associated with Internet giants such as Google, Facebook and Netflix. More specifically, by leveraging Pivotal’s cloud platform in its banking architecture transformation, DBS is now able to operate and deliver services to its customers exponentially faster, as well as build next-generation applications and user experiences rapidly, and update them with new features that will evolve with customer needs. Through this collaboration, DBS is set to reinvent banking and redefine the banking experience for over 6 million consumer and corporate customers across Asia. Said DBS Head of Group Technology and Operations David Gledhill: “Like many traditional industries, the banking sector is being disrupted by agile start-ups and fintech companies that are delivering a differentiated experience to customers. To compete effectively against these new entrants, DBS must have the ability to be responsive to customers. Pivotal Cloud Foundry gives us the software platform to think and act like a technology company and innovate at start-up speeds.” The built-in automation of Pivotal’s cloud platform also means DBS can now focus on delivering differentiated value, instead of being caught up with systems management and IT resource procurement. As a start, DBS is leveraging the Pivotal solution to build next-generation credit risk management systems and funds transfer pricing systems for the bank, as well as other systems. The move to adopt the cloud platform for application development underlines DBS’ commitment to digitally transform its operations from the front office to back-end processes, advancing its march to become a software company. As part of the collaboration, Pivotal is also working with DBS to equip the bank’s application development team with the next-generation software development services of Pivotal Labs, entrenching the culture of software innovation, usually associated with Silicon Valley’s most influential companies, right in the heart of a Singapore-headquartered bank. “The banking industry has long been saddled with legacy systems that can hinder the speed of innovation,” said Lionel Lim, Vice President and Managing Director, APJ, Pivotal. “DBS is a progressive bank that is laying the right foundation to digitally transform their operations to innovate like a software company. We are pleased to collaborate with DBS on this important transformation milestone.”  [END]    About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia  DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS launches Digital Account for SMEs with no minimum balance required,22 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_Digital_Account_for_SMEs_with_no_minimum_balance_required, Singapore ,"- To help SMEs keep banking costs low, DBS has launched a digital account for SMEs with no minimum balance required. They will also enjoy an annual fee waiver for the DBS Visa Business Advance Debit Card and have free access to DBS IDEAL™ corporate online banking and mobile app. The DBS Digital Account is suitable for young companies in Singapore, which have more than doubled from 23,000 in 2004 to 55,000 in 2014. As of 2014, these companies accounted for about 345,000 jobs according to data from SPRING Singapore. The DBS Digital Account was developed as many SMEs are increasingly going online for their banking needs. Today, almost 60% of DBS SME business accounts are applied for online, compared to 12% in 2014. Close to half of the bank’s SME customer base have conducted transactions via DBS’ corporate online and mobile banking platforms in the past year. SMEs who sign up for the DBS Digital Account and conduct their banking transactions online or via the mobile app, can look forward to cost savings vs banking at the bank branches. SME owners can open the DBS Digital Account online conveniently in five minutes, without having to visit a branch. Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said: “We have designed a digital-only account to give SME owners an option to keep banking costs low, especially when the operating environment has been more challenging in recent times. We are able to pass on some savings to SMEs and not charge fall-below fees by digitalising our processes and implementing more straight-through processing on the back end. We have also made the application process simple and convenient, making banking simpler, faster and efficient for busy SMEs.” George Li, Director of Projects & Innovation, Stamford Painters said: “With the DBS Digital Account, DBS is truly helping young SMEs. The ‘no-minimum’ balance requirement is useful as it gives my business flexibility in how I can use my cash to develop my painting business efficiently. I can also easily manage my banking with the mobile banking app.  The application process was simple, straightforward and fast - all I had to do was key in my business registration number and I was able to complete the application quickly.” The DBS Digital Account is the latest in a slew of initiatives by DBS to bring greater convenience and value to SME customers through digital banking. SMEs can also apply for loan products and bankers’ guarantee online, while on the go.

DBS and Manulife Bancassurance Partnership | 繁體,18 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Manulife_Bancassurance_Partnership, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank and Manulife Financial Asia Limited are pleased to announce the official launch of their 15-year regional distribution agreement covering Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Indonesia. As part of the agreement, effective 1 January 2016, Manulife will be the key provider of bancassurance solutions to DBS customers in these four markets. The partnership further strengthens DBS’ regional life insurance distribution capabilities, and significantly expands Manulife’s existing successful relationship with DBS. Prior to this, Manulife was already DBS’ main provider of insurance solutions in Hong Kong and Indonesia, and their second largest provider in Asia overall. With the official launch of the partnership, DBS and Manulife have agreed to co-fund up to SGD100 million over the next 15 years to be invested in digital technology and innovation enhancements. Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, DBS Bank, said: “This partnership represents the coming together of two leading organisations, combining DBS’ superior Asian banking franchise with the insurance and wealth management expertise of Manulife, a global leader with a long-term commitment to Asia. With the establishment of the joint fund, we will be able to focus on the development of innovative solutions to serve Asia’s fast-growing consumer base, and help them to fulfill their retirement and insurance needs.” Through this regional life bancassurance partnership, DBS’ six million retail, wealth and SME customers will gain access to Manulife’s best-in-class suite of life and health insurance solutions, across the bank’s extensive network of over 200 branches and its sales force of over 2,000 professionals, as well as via its internet and mobile banking platforms. Roy Gori, President and Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Asia, said: “As a result of this agreement, customers will benefit from DBS’ multi-channel approach, and take advantage of Manulife’s full range of innovative products which are tailored to suit all their financial needs. We look forward to working closely with DBS to secure a safer, better future for customers.” DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited CEO Sebastian Paredes said: “Our partnership with Manulife draws on the distinct strengths of both companies and represents a significant opportunity for DBS to build on and further expand our leadership position among affluent customers and SMEs in this very important market. We’re excited to focus our combined synergies on serving a broader range of customers with leading financial solutions to help them live an enjoyable life with greater peace of mind.” Manulife has been a major bancassurance partner of DBS in Hong Kong since 2009. Michael Huddart, Manulife’s Executive Vice President and General Manager for Greater China, said: “This 15-year agreement with DBS in Hong Kong allows us to gain further access to DBS’ retail, affluent and SME customers in the territory. Through our strong product design capabilities, coupled with DBS’ extensive customer reach, we are able to fulfill their protection and retirement needs and further strengthen our position as the pre-eminent retirement expert in Hong Kong.” To help better identify potential opportunities in Asia’s bancassurance market, DBS and Manulife recently commissioned Nielsen to conduct the inaugural DBS-Manulife Retirement Wellness Study (“Study”) about people’s preparedness for a successful retirement. For Hong Kong, the Study’s findings pointed to an overall retirement wellness reading of 39 points out of 100, based on wealth, health and social-related attributes. This can be attributed to Hong Kong people perceiving themselves as relatively less prepared financially. In terms of health attributes, the Study found that less than one in three respondents are confident that they can afford to pay for their healthcare and medical expenses during retirement. For social attributes, the Study found declining mental alertness or memory loss during retirement to be the top concern among the respondents. “As part of our holistic approach to financial solutions, we are also addressing Hongkongers’ concern over rising healthcare and medical expenses during their retirement,” Mr Huddart continued. “With the combined strength of DBS and Manulife, we will help the bank’s customers protect and build their wealth.” Since 1 January 2016, a comprehensive range of Manulife’s solutions has been available via DBS’ relationship managers and bancassurance specialists.

DBS to roll out conversational banking in mobile messaging apps by year end,17 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_roll_out_conversational_banking_in_mobile_messaging_apps_by_year_end, Singapore ,"- DBS, Singapore’s largest bank and a leading bank in Asia, has once again upped the ante in the innovation space, and plans to enable customers to bank conversationally from their preferred mobile messaging app by the end of the year. For the first time in Asia Pacific, DBS customers will be able to use natural language to converse with DBS from their favourite mobile messaging app, manage their money across accounts, track expenses and even make payments in the process. DBS is working with US-based Kasisto, a spin-off from SRI International which created the technology behind Siri (Apple's voice assistant), to deliver this service. Kasisto's conversational AI platform, KAI, powers smart bots and virtual assistants with deep banking knowledge. For a start, the conversational AI technology will allow DBS customers to access banking services quickly on Facebook Messenger by the end of the year. The service will first be launched in Singapore and India, followed by DBS’ other key markets. DBS also plans to extend this service to other mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat in the future. To view video on how it works, please click here . The launch of this service will give DBS customers another convenient option of accessing their bank accounts. For example, if customers want to check their balance in their bank accounts, they can simply text “How much do I have?” which will be answered promptly. DBS customers can also pay bills easily via this service. For example, by simply texting “Can you please pay my mobile bill?”, the request will be processed, but not before identifying the correct payee. Said Sandeep Lal, Regional Head of eBusiness, DBS Bank, “At DBS, we seek to seamlessly integrate banking into customers’ everyday lives, making banking simpler and more convenient for them. We know that our customers are spending time conversing on their favourite mobile messaging app, and we are immersing ourselves in the customer journey by making it easier and more convenient for them to engage us. With the launch of this service, they no longer have to leave their favourite mobile messaging app to conduct their banking. Customers can converse with their bank as they would their contacts, and we will handle the rest with a strong focus on security – it’s that simple.” Research has shown that people are spending more time on messaging apps and the launch of this service will allow DBS to connect with customers in a more direct and responsive manner [1] . In April, DBS launched “digibank”, India’s first mobile-only bank, a revolutionary offering which brings together an entire suite of ground-breaking technology – from biometrics to artificial intelligence (AI) – to enable customers to enjoy a whole new way of banking. Said Olivier Crespin, Group Head of Digital Bank, DBS Bank, “With increasingly tech-savvy customers and rising smartphone usage, we have designed our digital banking services to be innovative and nimble enough to address customer needs, and be able to provide an intuitive and relevant banking experience. Today, Kasisto's KAI already powers an artificial-intelligent virtual assistant in DBS digibank, India's first mobile-only bank. We are looking forward to rolling out banking via messaging to our customers in our key markets and we believe they will find this service to be useful and relevant to them.” In 2014, the bank made a commitment to investing SGD 200 million over three years in digital banking regionally and has since rolled out various initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time with their loved ones or doing the things that they care about. Some of these recent initiatives in Singapore include: • DBS digibank in Singapore – a breakthrough mobile app designed to make banking simpler, smarter and faster for customers in Singapore launched in March 2016. For the first time in Asia, customers are able to view their account balances with a simple swipe on their mobile devices or Apple Watch. This function, called the “Peek Balance”, does not require any pre-login and customers can choose to “peek” at any of their DBS/POSB deposit or credit card accounts. • DBS FasTrack – A first-of-its-kind app to be introduced by a bank in Singapore in September 2015, it provides a seamless ordering and payments solution for businesses while eliminating or drastically shortening customers’ wait time. • DBS SMS Banking – In October 2014, DBS introduced SMS Banking, allowing customers to perform simple banking transactions including checking account balances, performing card payments and fund transfers to their own accounts outside of the internet banking environment. • DBS PayLah! – A mobile wallet introduced in May 2014 to make peer to peer payments easier, now has more than 300,000 registered wallets. The bank also brought this app to Apple Watch, making it the first wearable bank in Singapore. DBS’ efforts to be at the forefront of banking innovation have also been recognised industry-wide through various accolades, testament to the strides that the bank has made in embracing the digital world. Most recently, DBS was named the ‘World’s Best Digital Bank’ by Euromoney, the first time an Asian bank has won an award in a global category by this publication. Earlier this year, the bank was named “Best Retail Bank in Asia Pacific” for the first time by The Asian Banker. DBS was also recognised as “Asia’s Trailblazer of the Year” for the fourth year running and for “Excellence in Internet Banking, Asia” at the Retail Banking International Awards.

POSB VTMs complement the wide array of existing services provided by the bank and pushes the envelope when it comes to the range of round-the-clock services customers can come to expect from a bank, without necessarily requiring more branch space or increase in manpower.  Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “We see the POSB Video Teller Machines as a game-changer for the industry, in terms of delivering round-the-clock branch banking services to our customers. Customers who urgently need to have their internet banking tokens or debit cards replaced after branch banking hours, will soon be able to go to POSB VTMs to have their token or card dispensed instantly to them, after verification. And just as important, those who require assistance – whether in operating the machine or for their other banking needs – are able to access instant ‘face-to-face’ teller assistance via live-video. The latter function is crucial because many of our customers still place great value in interacting with our staff. As POSB will always be neighbours first, bankers second, these relationships are something we value and wish to preserve even as we continue to push the boundaries in banking innovation.”  With DBS/POSB banking most of Singapore, the bank sees some 45,000 requests per month for replacement debit or ATM cards, and 7,500 requests per month for replacement internet banking tokens – mostly as a result of misplacement. To use the POSB VTMs, customers will need to have valid ID (such as their identity card or passport) or their ATM card for verification. POSB VTMs will also provide the option of biometric fingervein scanning for verification if required. With POSB VTMs, customers will be able to perform transactions such as: -              Balance enquiries -              Change of particulars -              Card services -              Instant replacement of debit and ATM cards -              Instant internet banking token replacement -              Changing fixed deposit arrangements -              Changing Giro arrangements -              Statement requests  POSB VTMs are the latest in a line of ground-breaking and first-of-its-kind service innovations introduced by DBS/POSB to enhance efficiency and customer convenience. These include the SMS ‘Q’ notification service, which allows customers to request for a queue number via SMS prior to visiting the bank’s branches; SMS Banking, where customers can perform simple banking transactions via SMS; and POSB Branch Machines, service machines that allow customers perform some over-the-counter transactions with branch staff assistance.  POSB VTMs are presently in pilot stage, with the first one situated at POSB ITE College Central branch at 2 Ang Mo Kio Drive. The machine can be accessed by the public from 10am to 2pm (Monday to Fridays) and 10am to 1pm (Saturdays) and selected functions, including internet banking token replacement, are currently available. More POSB VTMs will be progressively introduced to selected branches and the machines are expected to run with their full capabilities and be made available round-the-clock by the end of the year.

DBS launches DBS TechMatch to help SMEs find technology solutions,15 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_DBS_TechMatch_to_help_SMEs_find_technology_solutions, Singapore ,"- DBS, Infocomm Investments and IPI Singapore today announced the launch of DBS TechMatch, an initiative to help SMEs embark on innovation projects to solve business problems and build capabilities. SMEs in Singapore are encouraged to drive growth and build sustainable businesses through innovation and transformation. As part of the government’s Industry Transformation Programme, new support packages such as the Automation Support Package have been introduced to help defray costs associated with technology implementation and capability building. DBS TechMatch supports such government programmes and packages by matching SMEs to the appropriate innovation to solve business problems or build capabilities.  Ms Joyce Tee, Group Head, DBS SME Banking said: “Through our various BusinessClass initiatives, we learn that many SMEs are keen to adopt innovation projects but do not know where to start. We recognise that there is a gap so we decided to partner Infocomm Investments and IPI to help match SMEs with the appropriate technologies, based on their needs. We think that the partnership will be extremely beneficial to SMEs, given that IPI has a global network of technology partners and Infocomm Investments has a strong track record of helping businesses develop solution concepts.”  How it works SMEs will submit a DBS Techmatch request online, where they will be required to define a business problem. These requests will then be reviewed by the DBS BusinessClass team who will connect the SME with an existing solutions provider covering point-of-sale systems, inventory management software, customer relationship management systems etc.  For SMEs which are looking for specific technology and expertise, IPI sources for these through its international network and database of technology opportunities. Dr. Sze Tiam Lin, Director of IPI said: “IPI is pleased to bring its expertise in facilitating technology transfer and R&D cooperation between enterprises and its global network of technology partners.  We look forward to supporting the aspirations of SMEs to grow their businesses and enhance their competitive advantage through the adoption of technology and innovation.”  Finally, for SMEs with business problems that do not have ready technology solutions, Infocomm Investments takes them through a five-day “SPRINT Hacks” solution process with entrepreneurial university students teaming up with the SME to come up with a viable solution concept. A public demo of the solutions rounds off the SPRINT Hacks programme. Following this, SME business owners will then work with the solution providers to execute these proposed solution concepts to solve the problem(s) they need addressed.  “The core of Sprint methodology is design thinking on steroids, that drills down to the root of the issue, sharpens problem statements that are worth solving, rapidly prototypes and tests solutions to tackle these problems all within five days. SPRINT Hacks addresses critical business questions that SMEs often struggle to define. The outcome is innovation that addresses operation inefficiencies and new business opportunities identified. These are hugely beneficial to the problem owners (SMEs), solution providers and entrepreneurs,” Dr. Alex Lin, Head of Infocomm Investments said.

DBS first-half earnings at SGD 2.25 Billion | 繁體,08 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_half_earnings_at_SGD_2_25_Billion," Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, China, Hong Kong, Regional ","- DBS Group achieved net profit of SGD 2.25 billion for first half 2016. Excluding one-time items a year ago, net profit was slightly higher and a record. Total income increased 6% to a new high of SGD 5.78 billion. This was achieved through diversified growth, with net interest margin at a six-year high and record fee income. The results included a net allowance charge of SGD 150 million for DBS’ exposure to the Swiber group after drawing SGD 250 million from general allowance reserves. Cumulative general allowance reserves continued to be high at SGD 2.95 billion. Second-quarter net profit was SGD 1.05 billion, which was 6% lower compared to a year ago due to the net allowance charge. Total income rose 8% to a new quarterly high of SGD 2.92 billion as business momentum picked up during the quarter. Loans expanded 4% over the quarter led by corporate loans and market share gains in Singapore housing loans. Fee income climbed to a quarterly record. The cost-income ratio improved to 44% as cost growth decelerated. Profit before allowances increased 10% to SGD 1.63 billion. Total allowances for the half year rose 69% to SGD 536 million. The strong profit before allowances for the quarter and the half year provided a substantial cushion for absorbing the additional net allowances. While the non-performing loan rate rose to 1.1%, allowance coverage continued to be sound at 113% and at 226% if collateral was considered. Return on equity was 11.0% for the first half. The performance underscored the earnings resilience of the DBS franchise as it continued to capture opportunities across multiple business lines and generate healthy profit even in challenging operating conditions. First-half earnings unchanged as total income rises 6% For the first half, net interest income rose 7% to SGD 3.67 billion. Net interest margin improved 14 basis points to 1.86% in line with higher average Singapore-dollar interest rates. Loans grew 2% to SGD 285 billion. A 6% increase in non-trade loans from corporate loans and market share gains in Singapore housing loans more than offset a 22% contraction in trade loans Non-interest income rose 6% to SGD 2.12 billion. Net fee income increased 5% to SGD 1.20 billion from broad-based growth. Wealth management fees rose 4% to SGD 355 million as bancassurance income grew. Investment banking fees increased 35% to SGD 105 million from strong debt and equity capital market activities. Card fees rose 7%to SGD 222 million from increased credit and debit card transactions in Singapore. Transaction banking fees grew 2% to SGD 290 million as an 11% increase in cash management fees more than offset a decline in trade finance fees. Other non-interest income was 6% higher at SGD 916 million from higher gains from investment securities. Trading income was stable as a decline in treasury customer sales was offset by higher trading gains. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income increased 19% to SGD 2.09 billion, led by higher income from loans, deposits and bancassurance. Income from the Wealth Management customer segment rose 8% to SGD 806 million with assets under management growing 6% to SGD 151 billion. Institutional Banking income was little changed at SGD 2.65 billion. While cash management, capital market and loan activities grew, trade finance and treasury customer sales were lower due to uncertainty related to China and the renminbi. Treasury income fell 13% to SGD 578 million from the high base a year ago. Total expenses increased 6% to SGD 2.55 billion and the cost-income ratio was 44%. Profit before allowances was 6% higher at SGD 3.23 billion. Total allowances rose 69% to SGD 536 million. They included a net allowance charge of SGD 150 million for Swiber. Second-quarter results underpinned by 8% rise in total income For the second quarter, net profit fell 6% from a year ago to SGD 1.05 billion. Total income increased 8% to a new quarterly high of SGD 2.92 billion, exceeding cost growth of 6%. The 10% increase in profit before allowances was more than offset by higher allowances. Net interest income rose 5% to SGD 1.83 billion. Net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 1.87% while loans were 2% higher. Non-interest income was 13% higher at SGD 1.09 billion. Net fee income rose 8% to SGD 628 million, led by growth in investment banking, transaction banking and loan-related activities. Other non-interest income grew 22% to SGD 458 million from higher trading income and gains from investment securities. The cost-income ratio improved from 45% a year ago to 44% as a result of disciplined cost management. Total expenses rose 6% to SGD 1.29 billion as year-on-year cost growth decelerated. Total allowances more than doubled to SGD 366 million as a result of the net allowances of SGD 150 million for Swiber. Second-quarter earnings 13% lower than previous quarter Second-quarter net profit was 13% below the record earnings in the previous quarter. While total income and profit before allowances were higher, the impact was offset by an increase in total allowances. Net interest income was stable. Loans grew SGD 11 billion or 4% in constant-currency terms. The increase was led by corporate loans and market share gains in Singapore housing loans. Trade loans also rose, by 8%, reversing several quarters of contraction. Net interest margin was little changed at 1.87% as the impact of lower Singapore-dollar interest rates was offset by a more efficient balance sheet and reduced deposit costs. Non-interest income was 5% higher. Net fee income increased 9% as investment banking income quadrupled from stronger debt and equity capital market activities. Other non-interest income was unchanged. Total expenses rose 2%. Staff costs were 3% lower as headcount fell slightly, while technology and general expenses were higher. Total allowances of SGD 366 million were double the previous quarter. Excluding the allowances for Swiber, specific allowances for credit exposures were little changed. Balance sheet remains healthy Asset quality remained sound. While the non-performing rate rose to 1.1%, allowance coverage was comfortable at 113% and at 226% if collateral was considered. The average liquidity coverage ratio for the second quarter was 116%, comfortably above the final regulatory requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above regulatory requirements due in 2018. Capital was also healthy with the Common Equity Tier-1 ratio at 14.2%. The leverage ratio was at 7.7%, more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. The Board declared a first-half dividend of 30 cents per share, unchanged from a year ago. The scrip dividend scheme will be applicable to the dividend. Scrip dividends will be issued at the average of the closing prices on each of 15, 16 and 17 August 2016. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “We achieved two consecutive quarters of record total income despite a challenging operating environment in the first half. The strong income growth in the second quarter enabled profit before allowances to grow 10%. Despite an unexpected significant allowance charge, first-half earnings were at a record. The performance demonstrates our ability to consistently capture opportunities across our businesses and effectively manage costs. While there remains some uncertainty in the second half, our business momentum is good and our balance sheet healthy. We are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead.” [End]  About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

"POSB pays tribute to nation with launch of heritage gallery and brings back iconic ""Save-As-You-Earn"" (SAYE) programme",03 Aug 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_pays_tribute_to_nation_with_launch_of_heritage_gallery_and_brings_back_iconic_Save_As_You_Earn_SAYE_programme, Singapore ,"- In the lead up to the nation’s 51st birthday, POSB, Singapore’s oldest and most loved bank, today announced the return of the iconic POSB Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) programme. In addition, the bank has set up a month-long public exhibition, the POSB Gallery, at the National Library Building that charts the bank’s journey from its inception in 1877 to present day. First launched in 1974, the POSB SAYE programme was introduced to encourage Singaporeans to cultivate a habit of setting aside a portion of their salary as savings. Those who did so were rewarded with bonus interest on their savings. The initiative was so effective in encouraging Singaporeans to start saving regularly that by the end of 1974, the bank had more than 800,000 savings accounts with deposits totalling some SGD 296.4 million, up from 600,000 depositors and SGD 125 million in deposits in 1972. [1]   In June this year, the programme was reintroduced and offered exclusively to full-time national servicemen (NSFs) to recognise their contributions towards nation building under the POSB “Save As You Serve” (SAYS) programme. The programme was lauded by the public and NSFs alike for encouraging NSFs to take early steps towards saving a portion of their salary. The demand for a programme such as POSB SAYS was demonstrated by the substantial rises in salary crediting and deposits by NSFs after its launch.  POSB has now expanded the savings programme to include all Singapore customers, effectively bringing back the POSB SAYE. To participate, customers simply need to have a DBS/POSB savings account where their monthly salary is credited to. They can then sign up for a POSB SAYE account where a stipulated amount (between SGD 50 to SGD 3,000) is transferred every month from their DBS/POSB salary-crediting account. The bank will then provide a bonus interest rate of 2% per annum on their monthly contributions in their POSB SAYE account. For more information or to sign up for an account, visit www.posb.com.sg/saye .  Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director & Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “When POSB SAYE was first launched in 1974, it was unique in the industry – no other bank in Singapore had a savings programme like it. The programme was pivotal in inculcating the habit of thrift among Singaporeans and many of us still routinely set aside a portion of our monthly salary for a rainy day. We believe POSB SAYE is still relevant today and by bringing it back with an attractive 2% bonus interest as incentive, we hope to carry on POSB’s enduring legacy of encouraging generations of Singaporeans to save.”  POSB customer Jasmine Yeo, 44, recalls, “It was really convenient for me because our salaries were credited into POSB as well so it was very natural to open POSB SAYE which auto-deducted from my salary every month. My pay was very low then so without the scheme, it would be very easy to spend everything when it comes in!""  POSB is also marking National Day this year with the launch of the POSB Gallery at the National Library Building.

DBS to leverage Amazon Web Services Cloud,27 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_leverage_Amazon_Web_Services_Cloud, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank, which has been on the forefront of digital transformation, continues to lead the charge in re-architecting its technology so as to be more “fintech-like” and responsive to customer needs. The bank said today it has signed an agreement with leading infrastructure provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to leverage its cloud technology. With this, DBS will create a hybrid cloud environment optimised for rapid changes of capacity and functionality, which is complementary to the bank’s traditional use of data centres. DBS’ early adoption of cloud among financial sector players comes amid a digital revolution that is redefining the banking industry. With the use of cloud, the bank is better able to experiment in a digital way as well as deliver new applications rapidly, while adhering to the highest standards of security. Said DBS Head of Technology and Operations, David Gledhill: “In today’s fast-changing world, companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix are widely acknowledged as leaders in innovation. What sets them apart is their ability to constantly experiment, automatically scale and rapidly bring new features to market. They are able to do this in part by leveraging the flexibility provided by cloud technology.” DBS’ agreement with AWS was signed after an extensive period of evaluation by DBS, as well as Proof of Concept experimentation, to explore how AWS can be leveraged to augment the bank’s existing data centres. DBS has worked to ensure the implementation meets the requirements of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Technology Risk Management guidelines. In addition, DBS has established additional technology standards, internal approval toll gates, and data encryption standards specific to its adoption of cloud. “DBS’ commitment to migrate significant workloads to AWS is a reflection of their focus not only on providing the best experience for their customers, but also on being a leader in Singapore’s rapidly evolving financial services market,” said Nick Walton, Head of ASEAN, Amazon Web Services. “We are excited that DBS has chosen AWS to support their digital transformation, so that they can take advantage of the many benefits of the AWS Cloud infrastructure, which has been architected to be the most secure, reliable, and flexible cloud computing environment in the world. AWS continues to work closely with financial institutions around the world so that they can move to the cloud with confidence.” One of the first use cases for AWS is in DBS’ Treasury and Markets (T&M) business. The bank will leverage AWS for the purpose of pricing and valuing financial instruments for risk management as this requires extensive computing power. AWS gives DBS the flexibility to rapidly scale the capacity of its computing grid up or down, without having to make provisions for permanent overcapacity. In the T&M case, it will allow the bank to have a quick and yet cost-effective way of handling short term surges in trading volumes such as those recently caused by Brexit. The bank envisages extending its usage of AWS over time and may shift up to 50% of its compute workload to cloud within a two-year period. This will result in dramatic cost savings, increased resilience and the ability to rapidly respond to customer demand. Over the last five years, DBS has made significant investments in strategic technology initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time on people or things that they care about. This includes initiating a comprehensive re-architecture of the bank’s technology as well as catalysing a change in culture within the bank to one that is more “fintech-like” in nature.

DBS appoints Joseph Poon as regional head of South East Asia and promotes Lawrence Lua as deputy head of private bank,27 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_appoints_Joseph_Poon_as_regional_head_of_South_East_Asia_and_promotes_Lawrence_Lua_as_deputy_head_of_private_bank," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS, Singapore’s largest bank and the only Singaporean bank among the top six wealth managers in Asia, announced today that Joseph Poon has been appointed as the Regional Head of South East Asia, DBS Private Bank, effective 16 August 2016. Joseph was most recently Head of UBS Wealth Management - Ultra High Net Worth (clients with over CHF 50 million of bankable assets) and Global Family Office businesses for South East Asia. He is a veteran in the wealth management industry and has held various senior positions at several leading private banks, including Julius Baer, Macquarie Private Bank Asia and JPMorgan Singapore. Joseph will be reporting to Lawrence Lua, who has been promoted to Deputy Head of DBS Private Bank. Lawrence was previously Head of South & Southeast Asia at DBS Private Bank and will continue to report to Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management. Lawrence joined DBS Private Bank in 2011 and has been instrumental in driving the bank’s private banking business in South and Southeast Asia. His promotion underscores DBS’ commitment to internal mobility and talent development as the bank continues to build upon its successes in the region. Together with Joseph, Jun Tjandra, Head of North Asia Private Banking and Rob Ioannou, Head of International, will report to Lawrence. Said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, DBS Bank, “As we further entrench our position as a leading wealth manager in Asia, we believe that it is important to identify and build deep bench strength in our bank. With these senior appointments, we are ready to take our private banking business to the next level with a strong focus on the ultra high net worth segment and the digital evolution. As we execute against our strategy to achieve our ambition of becoming the wealth manager of choice, we will continue to focus on enhancing the delivery of our financial and banking capabilities to our clients. This includes our initiatives to deliver the next generation client experience in providing advice and the ongoing development of our best-in-class digital wealth platform.” Over the last few years, DBS Private Bank has grown to become the sixth largest wealth manager in Asia Pacific. According to an April 2016 ranking released by Asian Private Banker, a wealth management industry publication, it is the only Singaporean bank in the top six and the latest ranking brings the bank to within a whisker of its aim of being among the top five wealth managers in the region. The growth of DBS’ wealth management franchise is robust, fuelled by the organic growth of emerging Asian new wealth and also by its successful execution of a wealth continuum. After the successful acquisition of Société Générale Private Banking Asia in 2014, DBS Private Bank continues to grow from strength to strength. It has also consistently achieved growth of about 20% annually since 2010. As of March 2016, DBS’ high net worth assets under management (HNWIs with more than SGD1.5 million each in investible assets) and assets under management for all wealth customers stood at SGD101 billion and SGD147 billion respectively. In 2015, DBS Private Bank was named the world’s ‘Most Innovative Private Bank’ by three of the industry’s leading journals. Most recently, DBS was named the ‘Best Asian Private Bank’ by FinanceAsia and ‘Best Wealth Manager, Asia’ by The Asset, and more notably, as the ‘World’s Best Digital Bank’ by Euromoney, the first time an Asian bank has won an award in a global category by this publication. These accolades are an endorsement of DBS’ strong culture of innovation and client focus.

DBS to start securities business in Japan,25 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_to_start_securities_business_in_Japan, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, announced today that it will commence its securities business in Japan on 18th of August. With this new move, DBS will be able to better support institutional investors and companies in Japan looking to invest and tap the financial markets in Asia. Given the domestic growth and rapidly aging population in Japan, institutional investors in Japan are actively seeking for yield and investments in overseas markets. At the same time, with rapid economic growth in Asia, there are now more Asian investment-grade companies which offer institutional investors in Japan diversification to their US/European portfolios. DBS is able to introduce strong Asian credits with higher yields to Japanese investors, as an alternative to the low and negative interest rate environment in Japan currently. Ms Mana Nabeshima will spearhead DBS’ expansion in Japan. She joined DBS in 2015 and was tasked to build the bank’s Japan business across all product segments. Prior to joining DBS, she was a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs in Singapore and Tokyo for 12 years, covering the Japanese institutional segment in the fixed income division. She has also worked in derivatives sales and private banking at Citibank. Said Ms Nabeshima: “This year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Japan so we are pleased to be able to contribute to Japan’s financial markets by expanding our service offering to institutional investors and companies in Japan. DBS will be able to act as an intermediary of investment flows between Asian corporates and Japanese investors with our high credit rating, strong capital position, unique Asian insights and extensive network in Asia.” DBS has been committed to Japan since the opening of the Tokyo branch in 1977. Japan and Singapore have strong economic ties and are the second-largest foreign direct investors in each other's countries.

Fiery competition sees nine start ups selected for DBS HotSpot 2016 Pre-Accelerator programme,21 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Fiery_competition_sees_nine_startups_selected_for, Singapore ,"- Following an intense three months of training and experimentation, nine start-ups were selected from DBS’s HotSpot Bootcamp to move on to the next stage – the Pre-Accelerator. Now in its second year, DBS HotSpot 2016 attracted over 250 applications from diverse sectors, including finance and digital technology, food and beverage and travel. In addition to those from the start-up community, the programme welcomed social entrepreneurs and aspiring innovators from within DBS itself – the bank  encourages its own staff with innovative ideas to take part. Out of these, 29 teams were chosen for the DBS HotSpot Bootcamp before nine were eventually picked for the final segment of the programme. As part of the Pre-Accelerator, the nine teams will receive a SGD 25,000 entrepreneur award, which does not require the teams to give up any equity. This will give them a boost as they continue to focus on product development and sales strategies. They will also receive legal advice and training on skills such as marketing and pitch presentations as they work towards securing funding from the investment community. “Over the past few months, the mentors in HotSpot had only good things to say about all the start-ups they worked with. But these nine teams really stood out against their peers and had progressed tremendously during Bootcamp. While we would have loved to work with more of the start-ups, competition was tough and we had to be selective of who we could fund for the Pre-Accelerator. It was not an easy decision,” said Neal Cross, DBS’ Chief Innovation Officer. The teams were chosen based on the clarity of their ideas and concepts, how innovative their idea was and the viability of their business solution. They were selected by DBS executives and partners. Said Jeffery Sung, co-founder of HugProperty.com and a Senior Vice President at DBS, “""Hotspot showed me how truly important it is to change, and change fast until the customer falls in love with us. The support I got from both the local start-up community and DBS was immense. It’s truly amazing how the bank is empowering our people and the experience has been invaluable in helping me see how to better serve customers."" Added Yuhwen Foong, Founder & CEO of SushiVid, “HotSpot Bootcamp has given me an excellent overview of all the tasks that I needed to consider to scale my business.  The team at DBS Innovation Group is really amazing and very passionate about start-ups.” DBS HotSpot 2016 Pre-Accelerator will begin in August and culminate in November on Demo Day where the final nine teams will pitch their businesses to a live audience of corporate executives, angel and venture capital investors and accelerators from the region.

DBS/POSB staff help raise dementia awareness across Singapore,20 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBSPOSB_staff_help_raise_dementia_awareness_across_Singapore, Singapore ,"- To mark DBS’ 48th anniversary, some 600 staff from across the bank are volunteering their services from 19 to 21 July by visiting homes of the elderly as well as senior activity centres to help raise awareness of dementia risks and prevention, conduct workshops on active ageing as well as perform needs assessment surveys. Staff will also be presenting gifts from DBS to the elderly. The initiative is part of the bank’s staff volunteer movement “People of Purpose”, which promotes values of leadership and empathy among staff by leveraging employees’ time and expertise to make meaningful contributions to communities. Said Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications at DBS Bank, “As a purpose-driven organisation, we believe that it is imperative for us to create impact beyond banking. This initiative goes beyond a single volunteer engagement and goes to buttress other forms of support we have been providing the elderly. This includes training our branch staff in dementia awareness; hiring seniors to assist other seniors in our branches; providing free financial literacy workshops; and mobilising our digital banking channels to provide fundraising and revenue streams for charities that support the elderly.”  The needs assessment survey activity is an initiative conducted in partnership with Lions Befrienders, a VWO that aims to aid in the psycho-emotional, social, and physical well-being of the elderly, and Forget Us Not, an initiative by Lien Foundation and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) to raise dementia awareness. The survey is particularly crucial as the data will help Lions Befrienders to identify elderly who might be at risk of dementia while also assessing their current standards of living. Collecting this data is time-consuming work, and requires a significant amount of manpower. To assist with this work, DBS/POSB staff volunteers have also undergone training beforehand on how to engage with the elderly.  Lions Befrienders executive director Dr Chey Chor Khoon said, “At Lions Befrienders (LB), we really appreciate the strategic partnership built with the committed team at DBS since 2014, when DBS launched its People of Purpose volunteer movement. The seniors at LB have benefitted so greatly from the dedicated and warm support of DBS throughout the years. This year, we’re grateful for the innovative initiatives from the LB/DBS partnership; which resulted in synergy created on various fronts, from volunteers, to banking channels, and knowledge transfer.”  At workshops on active ageing, staff volunteers will help educate seniors at senior activity centres on dementia symptoms as well as risk factors and how to lower these risks. Staff volunteers will also join the seniors in craft-making workshops, with items produced going towards fundraising for Lions Befrienders.  Said Dr. Philip Yap, Director of the Geriatric Centre at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, “Active ageing involves regular engagement of our minds and bodies, not forgetting having rich social networks too. It reduces the risk of dementia and depression, keeps chronic ailments in check and increases a person's productive years. Active ageing benefits us, our families and the society, and should be a way of life for all.”  According to Forget Us Not, there are currently 45,000 persons with dementia in Singapore and it is projected that this figure will more than double to 103,000 by 2030. In Singapore, one in every 10 persons aged 60 years and above has dementia, while one in every two persons aged 85 years and above has dementia. With Singapore being one of the fastest-ageing countries in the world, DBS/POSB has been investing in communities and services to prepare itself for the future challenges of an ageing population.  “All of us need meaningful relationships and a sense of belonging to enhance our wellbeing. Similarly, our elderly with dementia need the support and understanding of the community to help them stay connected, have better quality of life and to age-in-place with dignity,"" said Mr Lee Poh Wah, CEO, Lien Foundation. ""Just as society seeks to embrace children with special needs, we ought to include persons with dementia into our community’s realm of care so that they can continue to be part of our world. If it takes a village to raise a child, it certainly also takes a village to care for the frail elderly.”  Earlier this year, most of the bank’s branch and location managers attended training workshops conducted by Forget Us Not to better understand customers who have dementia. The training gives staff greater empathy on what it is like to have dementia, and advises staff on how to engage with customers with dementia. With the training, managers are in turn equipped to train the other staff in DBS/POSB’s branches on engaging with customers who may have dementia.  In 2009, POSB – in partnership with the Council for Third Age (C3A) – began the POSB Active Neighbours programme to hire and train seniors to assist others at POSB branches, with the overall aim of promoting an active lifestyle for older Singaporeans. Today, the bank has more than 80 Active Neighbours working at its POSB branches. POSB Active Neighbours also serve as digital ambassadors. Armed with iPads, they are able to assist and offer walk-in customers online banking options where applicable.

DBS and Singtel launch resource packages to help SMEs enhance e-commerce and cashless capabilities in the second edition of 99% SME campaign,15 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Singtel_launch_resource_packages_to_help_SMEs_enhance, Singapore ,"- DBS and Singtel today announced the launch of a suite of resource packages to help SMEs in Singapore enhance their capabilities with e-commerce and cashless payments, as part of the 99% SME campaign. The campaign will also rally consumers to shop with SMEs during the SME Week from 14-23 October. The campaign, which is in its second year, is supported by SPRING Singapore, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), trade associations*  and chambers of commerce and industry**. The official media partner is MediaCorp and MasterCard is a strategic sponsor. Ms Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said: “The 99% SME campaign is a result of a nationwide, public-private-partnership that supports the government’s  emphasis on building local capability as SMEs now play an even more crucial role to shape the future of Singapore’s economy. Together with our partners, we are focusing our efforts on helping SMEs build capabilities in e-commerce, become more efficient by adopting cashless solutions and gain new skills with specially designed training programmes.” The inaugural campaign last year saw over 1,600 SMEs sign up to participate in the SME Week and helped reach more than a million people through social media to garner public pledges of support. As a result, some SMEs have reported increased sales of up  to 50% during that period. Mr Andrew Lim, Managing Director, Business Group, Group Enterprise at Singtel said, “The previous year's campaign results exceeded our expectations and reinforced our resolve to help our SMEs. We will build on last year's momentum with our partners to help even more SMEs and go beyond our support we offered previously. Through the resource package this year, Singtel will help participating SMEs hone their competitive edge by going digital with a simple and affordable e-commerce solution and training courses. To jumpstart their growth, we will rally our many customers and employees in Singapore to lend their support to the SMEs.” Mr Ted Tan, Deputy Chief Executive, SPRING Singapore, said: “SPRING remains a strong supporter of the 99% SME Campaign as it enters its second year, and we are delighted to collaborate with DBS and Singtel to drive capability upgrading efforts in our local SMEs to help them grow. The efforts to drive the adoption of cashless and e-commerce solutions are critical especially in this age of increasingly digitally-savvy consumers. We encourage the business community to participate in this campaign and leverage the platforms to build up business capabilities and skillsets to address the market needs.” Cashless and e-commerce solutions SMEs can look forward to a suite of resource packages with preferential pricing and fee waivers to help them adopt cashless and e-commerce solutions. These solutions aim to increase productivity, reduce staff workload, improve customer experience and help businesses reach new customers. DBS, in partnership with Applied Mesh, will be offering the first 10 participating SMEs in the food & beverage industry a sponsorship package as well as 25% discount on the monthly subscription fee when they adopt DBS FasTrack. DBS FasTrack is a payment and ordering solution that allows F&B SMEs to quickly launch their own mobile apps where customers can place advance orders and payment, eliminating queue times for customers. Chain F&B outlets such as Old Tea Hut, OKG Express and Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant have adopted this solution since it was commercially available last month. The solution is pre-qualified under IDA’s Enhanced iSPRINT scheme as an Emerging tech solution for the F&B sector to help eligible SMEs offset the cost of deployment. To give participating SMEs a good head start to e-commerce, Singtel will be providing the first 500, with a complete and affordable e-commerce solution, under the Singtel e-commerce Solution resource package, for 99 cents a day during the initial six months. Through workshops and hands-on facilitation, the resource package can help SMEs to easily create online stores, in a matter of hours for some and a few days for others. In addition, Singtel will provide marketing training for SMEs to help them attract and retain online customer eyeballs to sustain their sites. To encourage SMEs to adopt cashless payment solutions, DBS and NETS are offering annual fee, set-up fee and terminal subscription fee waivers totalling SGD1,036 in the first year for the first 250 new merchants who sign up for the unified NETS and DBS Card Acceptance service. With the new unified service, merchants only need to install one terminal for both NETS and credit card payments. DBS will also extend to all participating SMEs an exclusive SGD10,000 overdraft facility with an attractive 6% interest rate, which is one of the lowest interest rates for overdrafts available in the market currently, to help small enterprises optimise their cash flow. Training courses at DBS Academy This DBS Academy and partners of the 99% SME campaign will offer training courses to SMEs and their employees to upgrade their knowledge and kick-start their online store. Singtel and DBS will be working with SPRING to organise seminars/workshops to help SMEs better understand e-commerce, including areas such as data analytics, digital marketing and cyber security. Other courses in the pipeline include cash management and working capital optimisation, managing financial market risk, accounting and taxation basics. Opened in December 2015, the DBS Academy sets a new benchmark for innovative learning spaces and approaches in the region. Advertising grant from Mediacorp Mediacorp will also be giving out SGD300,000 in an advertising grant to three SMEs in a contest on www.Toggle.sg , Mediacorp’s digital entertainment and lifestyle service. Consumers will be invited to submit photos of their favourite SME with a short caption. The campaign organisers will then shortlist 10 SMEs and produce videos of them for public voting. The top three SMEs with the highest votes will each receive a SGD 100,000 advertising grant from Mediacorp. Rallying consumers to patronise SMEs during SME Week The campaign will culminate with a 10-day SME Week where there will be a drive for consumers to buy from participating SMEs. In the weeks leading up to the SME Week, consumers can check out the special deals offered by participating SMEs on the 99% SME website ( www.99sme.sg ) and share them with their friends - it will list all participating SME online stores for prospective customers. The SME Week will be held from 14-23 October 2016. In addition, to attract more shoppers, DBS and Singtel will also be rewarding their customers who shop with participating SMEs.

This applies to those who spend at least S$99 on a single receipt at a participating SME store on the same day, either at the online or physical shop.  In total, there are 9900 free music packs to be given away.

DBS private bank appoints Jeremy Parlons as UK Market Wealth Management Head,12 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_private_bank_appoints_Jeremy_Parlons_as_UK_market_wealth_management_head, Singapore ,"- DBS Private Bank, Singapore’s largest bank and the only Singaporean bank among the top six wealth managers in Asia, announced today that Jeremy Parlons has been appointed as the UK Market Wealth Management Head. Jeremy will be heading up a new wealth management office, based in London, which will serve ultra high net worth (UHNW) clients and family offices who are looking to Asia for an edge to both their business and investment needs. Through DBS’ focus on digital innovation and its one-bank approach across wealth management, corporate banking and capital markets, the team will be able to leverage the best of the bank to deliver an integrated and efficient client-focused solution. “Over the years, we have made significant strides in our wealth management franchise. We continuously strive to leverage the best of DBS and combine our wealth management solutions with our clients’ wealth creation needs. Our strong corporate and commercial banking franchise in Asia allows us to provide our clients with regional connectivity and understanding of all our major Asian markets. Our expansion into UK makes us an attractive option for clients who are looking at Asia as an investment destination, coupled with our in-depth bank-wide expertise, and heritage and reputation as Asia’s safest bank,” said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, DBS Bank. DBS Private Bank has grown to become the sixth largest wealth manager in Asia Pacific. According to an April 2016 ranking released by Asian Private Banker, a wealth management industry publication, it is the only Singaporean bank in the top six and the latest ranking brings the bank to within a whisker of its aim of being among the top five wealth managers in the region.  The growth of DBS’ wealth management franchise is robust, fuelled by the organic growth of emerging Asian new wealth and also by its successful execution of a wealth continuum. After the successful acquisition of Société Générale Private Banking Asia in 2014, DBS Private Bank continues to grow from strength to strength. It has also consistently achieved growth of about 20% annually since 2010. As of March 2016, DBS’ high net worth assets under management (HNWIs with more than SGD1.5 million each in investible assets) and assets under management for all wealth customers stood at SGD101 billion and SGD147 billion respectively. In 2015, DBS Private Bank was named the world’s ‘Most Innovative Private Bank’ by three of the industry’s leading journals. Most recently, DBS was named the ‘Best Asian Private Bank’ by FinanceAsia and ‘Best Wealth Manager, Asia’ by The Asset, and more notably, as the ‘World’s Best Digital Bank’ by Euromoney, the first time an Asian bank has been awarded in a global category by this publication. These accolades are an endorsement of DBS’ strong culture of innovation and client focus. Jeremy specialises in managing wealth for the UHNW community and brings on board close to two decades of banking experience, offering both traditional services and bespoke solutions to many prominent individuals, family offices and investment boutiques. He has spent the last four years building RBC Wealth Management London’s exposure to UHNW and Family Office clients as well as working on several cross-banking client transactions and collaboration committees. Prior to this he spent nine years with Credit Suisse Private Banking (London) where he achieved several “One Bank” awards for his client work with Investment Banking and Asset Management divisions. Jeremy started his banking career in the private client division of Morgan Stanley, London. Jeremy holds the Chartered FCSI designation and a Masters in International Business from Université Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, France.

DBS named world’s best digital bank,11 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_named_worlds_best_digital_bank," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank has received worldwide recognition for its digital agenda, becoming the first bank to be named World’s Best Digital Bank at the prestigious Euromoney Awards for Excellence. According to Euromoney, “the award for the world’s best digital bank was one of the hardest-fought of all”, with BBVA, Citi and ING named as other strong contenders for this hotly contested award. In the end, DBS pipped the others for the global award because of the all-pervasive nature of its digital transformation. ""Leaders in digital banking talk about the difference between digitising aspects of a bank and creating a truly digital financial institution,"" said Clive Horwood, editor of Euromoney magazine. ""DBS is doing this better than any other bank. It is demonstrably the case that digital innovation pervades every part of DBS, from consumer to corporate, SMEs to transaction banking and even DBS Foundation."" DBS’ win marks the first time a Singapore as well as Asian bank has won a global accolade from Euromoney, one of the world’s leading financial publications. Euromoney also named DBS Asia’s Best Bank, another first for a Singapore bank. Said Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Bank, “At DBS, we believe that banks tomorrow will look fundamentally different from banks today. That’s why we have spent the past three years deeply immersed in the digital agenda. This has been an all-encompassing journey, whether it is changing the culture and mindsets of our people, re-architecting our technology infrastructure, or leveraging Big Data, biometrics and AI to make banking simple and seamless for customers. Winning Euromoney’s World’s Best Digital Bank award is great encouragement to us, and testament to the strides we’ve made in re-imagining banking.” In Hong Kong in 2015, DBS became the first bank to launch a dedicated accelerator programme for FinTech startups. Since then, DBS Accelerator has been instrumental in supporting startup businesses and entrepreneurs to deliver breakthrough innovations in the world of finance. In April, DBS launched digibank in India, the country’s first mobile-only bank. Digibank is branchless, paperless and signatureless, and leverages a combination of groundbreaking technology such as biometrics and artificial intelligence to revolutionise the overall customer experience. Across its markets, DBS’ retail, wealth and corporate customers are also increasingly engaging with the bank digitally. In 2015, 16% of DBS’ new wealth customers opened accounts with the bank digitally. Today, over 90% of the bank’s remittances are also done by customers digitally using DBS Remit. To create a “fintech-like” workforce, the bank encourages its people to embrace a digital mindset through experiential learning and experimentation through programmes such as hackathons. Last year, more than 2,000 employees gained exposure to digital culture, agile methodology and other digital concepts.

POSB partners IDA’s mobile tech lab to launch e-savings programme for primary school students,10 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_PARTNERS_IDAS_MOBILE_TECH_LAB_TO_LAUNCH_ESAVINGS_PROGRAMME_FOR_PRIMARY_SCHOOL_STUDENTS, Singapore ,"- POSB has partnered the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) to launch an e-savings programme specifically targeted at primary school students. The “POSB eYoung Savers” programme is the first project by a bank which will be showcased on IDA Lab on Wheels, a bus-based interactive programme to ignite passion in technology among the young through engaging and experiential activities. The “POSB eYoung Savers” programme was unveiled today at the official opening of POSB Waterway Point branch by Dr. Janil Puthucheary, Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, and Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information & Ministry of Education. Through its numerous initiatives over the year, POSB, also fondly known as the People’s Bank, has inculcated the values of savings and thrift among the population. Through its collaboration with IDA, POSB hopes to promote financial literacy and further spread the culture of savings among the young, while incorporating elements of technology and robotics. Under the programme, up to 40 students use micro robots as totems that will move according to the light triggers on the board game. The board game is linked to a laptop, where students will be asked questions related to savings to accumulate points as they progress through the game. They will also experience various financial situations (e.g. earning interest on points accumulated after each round), in order to better understand the importance of savings and thrift. At the end of each game, each student will be given a “POSB Young Savers” kit, which will contain tips on savings and engaging activities to help kickstart a savings journey. The programme will be offered via IDA Lab on Wheels which will go to all primary schools in Singapore. Schools can visit IDA’s Infocomm Talent Portal to find out about the “POSB eYoung Savers” programme and the availability of IDA Lab on Wheels. Said Ms. Susan Cheong, Head of POSB, “POSB has served generations of Singaporeans and we are proud to carry on the tradition of inculcating the virtues of savings and thrift among the younger generation. We are delighted to embark on this meaningful project with IDA to engage the students in a digitally fun and interesting way. By keeping with the times, we want to continue to instill the tradition of a savings culture among the young while engaging them through robotics and experiential technology.” Mr. Khoong Hock Yun, Assistant Chief Executive, IDA said, “IDA Lab on Wheels has become an integral part of a primary school student’s tech experience. To-date, the programme has reached out to more than 25,000 students and 90 schools. We are excited to work with POSB in the e-savings programme that exposes students to interesting technology that enables them to tinker, experiment, and at the same time, gain financial literacy in a fun and engaging way. We hope more industry players will come forward to collaborate with us to create impactful programs using technology.” The IDA Lab on Wheels is an industry led initiative together with the Government, aimed at seeding students’ interest and exciting them to study technology via the experiential and engaging technology featured on the bus. The larger aim of the IDA Lab on Wheels is to reach out to students and encourage them to pursue tech as a curriculum or career choice. Over the years, DBS/POSB has inculcated the culture of savings and thrift in our youth through a number of initiatives. Some of these initiatives are: In January 2015, POSB brought back the iconic “POSB National School Savings Campaign” in conjunction with SG50. The original campaign, which was first introduced in 1969, proved to be popular with the community and achieved 100% participation from primary schools in Singapore. The annual POSB PAssion Run for Kids is the largest charity kids run in Singapore, organised jointly with People’s Association. Over SGD1 million is raised annually for the POSB PAssion Kids Fund which is utilised to support programmes and has benefited over 230,000 children in Singapore. POSB also works closely with Community Development Councils (CDCs) to create various savings programmes for less privileged children.

DBS completes first offshore RMB bond under the third China-Singapore Government-To-Government project | 繁體,08 Jul 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_completes_first_offshore_RMB_bond_under_the_third_China_Singapore_GovernmentToGovernment_project, Hong Kong ,"- DBS is pleased to announce that it has completed the first offshore RMB bond under the “China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity” project for Chongqing Grain Group. With an irrevocable RMB-denominated standby letter of credit by the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Chongqing Grain Group has issued a RMB 1 billion, 3-year bond, priced at 4.02%. DBS and ABC are Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners. This is the first time a corporate in Chongqing has issued offshore RMB bonds in Singapore and is able to repatriate the funds raised in full. The funds raised can also be used by Chongqing Grain Group outside Chongqing municipality for its business activities in China’s western region. Chongqing Grain Group CEO & Executive Manager Li Xu said: ""We are pleased to be the first company in Chongqing to issue an offshore RMB bond under the ‘China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity’ project. The bond issue not only helps us broaden our funding base, it also helps us optimise our capital structure. More importantly, we have set a precedent for other Chongqing companies to tap on this new source of international funding.” Clifford Lee, Head of Fixed Income, DBS Bank said, “At its peak, we saw orders in excess of RMB 9 billion from more than 100 investors, a strong testament to the market reception of the transaction. In this landmark deal, the issuer has directly benefited from the Chongqing-Singapore initiative to access offshore capital markets via Singapore and international investors have gained valuable insights and understanding into quality enterprises in Chongqing. We look forward to leveraging our experience with this inaugural issue and help other Chongqing enterprises tap the international capital markets.” Following the footsteps of the Suzhou Industrial Park and the Tianjin Eco-City projects, China and Singapore signed an agreement on 7 November 2015 to launch the third China Singapore Government-to-Government (“G-to-G”) project in Chongqing Municipality in Western China, based on the theme of modern connectivity and modern services. The collaboration will focus on four priority areas: (i) financial services; (ii) aviation; (iii) transport and logistics; and (iv) information and communications technology. DBS is amongst the first Singapore companies to participate in the third China Singapore “G-to-G” project, and has signed strategic agreements with Chongqing Municipal People's Government, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, China Construction Bank Corporation, Chongqing Liangjiang New Area Administrative Committee and Chongqing Yufu Assets Management Group Co. Ltd in January this year. DBS is committed to providing comprehensive financial services for the development of China-Singapore’s new economic partnership. DBS Bank (China) CEO Neil Ge said: “We are honoured to be one of the first banks to complete the first offshore RMB bond issued under the ‘China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity’ project and would like to thank the Chongqing government, Chongqing Grain Group, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Chongqing for their support. DBS is committed to leveraging our experience and expertise from developed financial markets such as Singapore and Hong Kong, to explore financial innovation with our partners as well as strengthen economic ties between Singapore, Chongqing and Western China.” Committed to China for over 20 years, DBS is amongst the first foreign banks and the first Singapore bank to locally incorporate in China. DBS Bank (China) Chongqing branch was established in January 2012 and is the bank’s first foray into Western China. In the last four years, DBS has actively supported many Western China and Chongqing companies in their overseas expansion, diversification of their funding bases as well as helped them reduce financing costs. DBS has also supported Chongqing Grain Group in their foray into syndicated loan financing. DBS led the Group’s first syndicated loan of USD 187.5 million in 2013. It was then the largest syndicated loan led by a foreign bank in China and was awarded “Best Project of the Year” by the China Banking Association. In March 2016, DBS Bank was also the lead arranger for Chongqing Grain Group’s USD126 million syndicated loan.

DBS – first Singapore bank to adopt cloud-based productivity technology in the workplace,27 Jun 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_Singapore_bank_to_adopt_cloud_based_productivity_technology_in_the_workplace, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank, which is at the forefront of re-imagining banking, is leading the charge in transforming its workforce for the digital age. The bank is the first Singapore bank to adopt cloud-based productivity technology, Office 365, in the workplace, enabling its employees to change the way they work, as well as make a leap forward in terms of mobility, efficiency and productivity. DBS’ early adoption of cloud among financial sector players comes amid Singapore’s smart nation drive as well as a digital revolution that is redefining the banking industry. With the increasing threat posed by fintechs, the bank believes it must empower its people with a set of productivity tools that enable them to be more nimble and responsive to customer needs. According to Michael Araneta, Associate Vice President for IDC Financial Insights Asia/Pacific, “Asia/Pacific super-regional institutions, like DBS, will set the pace. At least 80% of these FSIs [1] will run on a hybrid cloud architecture by 2018. These large players will clear the way for their peers and will set best practices in the location, control, ownership, and management of data in the cloud.” Said DBS Head of Technology and Operations David Gledhill, “In the last few years, we have made good headway in creating a ‘fintech-like’ workforce that is focused on making the customer experience simpler and more seamless. Inculcating a digital mindset in our people aside, it is also important to give them work tools that break down silos, enhance collaboration, foster greater efficiency and facilitate working on the go. By leading the industry in adopting cloud technologies, our people can in turn deliver more customer value.” Singapore is DBS’ testbed for Microsoft’s cloud-based productivity tool, with the bank piloting Microsoft Office 365 among about 1,000 staff today. The bank is targeting for its entire workforce to make a shift to cloud over the course of the year, when all 22,000 employees across 18 markets will be equipped with Office 365. With Office 365, DBS is now able to empower its workforce to work collaboratively from anywhere, across PCs, tablets and smartphones. Across the organisation, meetings can now be conducted through Skype for Business, cutting down on travelling time. Enterprise social network, Yammer, provides a platform for employees to form closer communities and to collaborate across departments and locations. In addition, to encourage knowledge sharing across DBS’ network of employees, every individual will receive an increment of file storage capacity to 1TB per user on OneDrive. Said Jessica Tan, Managing Director, Microsoft Singapore, “Microsoft is excited to partner DBS in its digital transformation as it leads the adoption of cloud technologies in the financial services industry here in Singapore. This leap will strengthen DBS’ mission to be Asia’s Safest and Asia’s Best as they build a more productive and collaborative workplace. In addition to discovering increased personal and organisational productivity, empowered employees connect and engage with customers in new ways as they gain new insights that will ultimately help the bank transform its products and services.” Office 365 adheres to the highest security standards for cloud technology in Singapore and globally [2] . This is an outcome of Microsoft working closely with the financial industry – on both customer and regulatory fronts – for several years, as well as its commitment to the industry. Microsoft has listened to industry leaders and regulators about their requirements, concerns and desires for cloud-based services, and learned about the industry’s needs surrounding compliance, security, privacy and control. Through these, Microsoft ensured its cloud platforms and services provide a regulatory framework that meets those needs. In recent years, DBS has been encouraging its employees to embrace a digital mindset through greater experimentation and experiential learning. For example, at DBS hackathons, staff work with startups to create prototypes that address business challenges. In 2015, more than 2,000 employees gained exposure to digital culture, agile methodology and other digital working concepts.  Beyond this, DBS employees also get to work with research and analytics experts from A*Star and the Singapore Management University to develop innovative products and services. Over the last five years, DBS has made significant investments in strategic technology initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time on people or things that they care about. For example, customers in Singapore can log on to digibank, a mobile app, using fingerprint and check their account balance with just one swipe. In April, DBS also launched India’s first mobile-only bank that is branchless, paperless and signatureless. Digibank in India combines a set of groundbreaking technology from biometrics to artificial intelligence. 1  Based on: IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Financial Services 2016 Predictions – APEJ Implications 2  Office 365 has achieved the Multi-Tier Cloud Security Standard for Singapore (MTCS SS) Level-3 certification for Office 365, the highest level of certification available, complementing the service’s global independent verification specified in ISO 27001, EU model clauses, HIPAA BAA and FISMA.

POSB launches Save-As-You-Serve programme to recognise contributions of national servicemen,20 Jun 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_launches_Save_As_You_Serve_programme_to_recognise_contributions_of_national_servicemen, Singapore ,"- POSB, Singapore’s oldest and most loved bank, today announced the launch of the “POSB Save-As-You-Serve” programme (POSB SAYS) to recognise the contributions of the country’s national servicemen towards nation building. In partnership with two Operationally-Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) associations, HomeTeamNS and SAFRA, POSB is the first bank in Singapore to offer a rewards programme specifically for full-time national servicemen (NSFs) and NSmen. The programme was unveiled today at a launch event by Mr. Desmond Lee, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, and President of HomeTeamNS. For a start, POSB will give NSFs a headstart in their savings journey by offering an attractive interest rate of 2% per annum on their monthly contribution in their “POSB SAYS” account opened with the bank for the entire duration of their full-time national service period. The “POSB SAYS” programme consists of a regular savings account that deducts a stipulated amount (available for amounts between SGD50 to SGD3,000) from a NSF’s DBS/POSB account where his NS allowance has been credited. Through this programme, POSB continues to inculcate the value of thrift by encouraging NSFs to cultivate a habit of setting aside a portion of their salary as savings. Currently, over 85% of NSFs bank with DBS/POSB and NSFs simply have to add a “POSB SAYS” account online at www.posb.com.sg/says . POSB will also be offering a SGD30 cash gift to NSFs who sign up before August 31, which will be credited to their HomeTeamNS-PAssion-POSB Debit Card and SAFRA DBS Debit Card. NSFs will also enjoy a 2% rebate on all local contactless spends made on their HomeTeamNS-PAssion-POSB Debit Card and SAFRA DBS Debit Card respectively. Other benefits under “POSB SAYS” include discounts at over 1,800 merchants islandwide when members pay with their HomeTeamNS-PAssion-POSB Debit Card or SAFRA DBS Debit Card. Said Mr. Jeremy Soo, Managing Director & Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “As a key institution in Singapore, POSB serves Singaporeans from all walks of life. This includes the young, families, seniors and the community at large. Through our various initiatives, we have always been supportive of our national servicemen and we really want to express our appreciation to them for their significant contribution to the nation. The ‘POSB Save-As-You-Serve’ programme will also give our full-time national servicemen a headstart in their savings journey, as they are amongst the first group of Singaporeans to enter the workforce. All HomeTeamNS and SAFRA members can also look forward to an enhanced suite of exclusive benefits, bringing about greater value and convenience to them.” Said Mr. Desmond Lee, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, and President of HomeTeamNS, “I am heartened to know that many companies share our vision to recognise our NS community and have partnered HomeTeamNS and SAFRA to introduce new  benefits to our members. Under the “Save-As-You-Serve” (SAYS) initiative, POSB will give NSFs a head-start in their savings journey by offering an attractive 2% per annum on their POSB SAYS accounts opened with the bank for the entire duration of their full-time national service period. Over 50,000 members, including NSFs and NSmen will also be able to earn higher cash rebates on contactless card payments made through their HomeTeamNS-PAssion-POSB Debit card or DBS SAFRA cards. I hope more partners will come on board to introduce other innovative programmes to recognise the contributions of our NSFs and NSmen in keeping Singapore safe and secure.” Mr. Donald Tan, Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Business Strategies), SAFRA, commented: “Helping NSmen save and stretch their dollar is a direct and significant way of showing our appreciation for their contributions.

We are excited to be one of the first in Hong Kong to support Apple Pay for a best-in-class mobile payment experience for our customers.

Security and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code. Apple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and benefits offered by credit and debit cards. In participating stores, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE and Apple Watch. Online shopping in apps accepting Apple Pay is simple, without needing to repeatedly fill out lengthy account forms or type in shipping and billing information. When paying for goods and services within apps, Apple Pay is compatible with iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro. DBS Hong Kong has and continues to invest considerable resources to drive innovation and digital banking, with many notable examples of first-in-market and award-winning initiatives in providing a joyful customer experience. Among them is iGO Rewards, an innovative one-stop travel rewards platform, and the award-winning DBS Omni Credit Card Companion Mobile App, which was launched early this year with four major “first-in-market” innovations.

DBS plans for voice biometrics at Singapore customer centre by year-end,20 May 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_plans_for_voice_biometrics_at_Singapore_customer_centre_by_year_end, Singapore ,"- DBS, the largest bank in Singapore, continues to remain at the forefront of leveraging technology to better improve the experience of callers into its customer centre. By the end of this year, the bank aims to make the customer centre experience even easier and more secure for customers with the introduction of voice biometric authentication in Singapore. This technology leverages the fact that humans have a unique voice print, similar to the fingerprint, which can be used to verify the customer. Its introduction will further reduce the time customers spend on authentication by between 20 and 40 seconds. Instead of having to remember passwords and answers to security questions, customers can be verified in 15 seconds or less as they speak to customer service officers (CSOs). Lena Low, Executive Director of Customer Centre at DBS said, “This is really about making banking joyful and delighting our customers. Voice biometrics is also more secure as customers do not have to worry about remembering their PIN or speaking about personal information in public when on the phone with CSOs.” Customers with a sore throat or who have to speak in a noisy area would still be verifiable as their voices are profiled by a number of identifiers such as speed of speech, cadence and pronunciation. Voice print cannot be reverse engineered once stored. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS, “We design our banking services to be innovative and nimble to address customer needs, as well as to provide an intuitive and interactive banking experience. With voice biometrics, customers will no longer need to remember different passwords and answers to security questions. We seek to seamlessly integrate banking into our customers’ everyday lives and this new capability will offer them an effortless and more secure way to access banking services.” The initiative follows on from the bank’s launch of an enhanced dynamic interactive voice response (IVR) system at the customer centre in December 2015. Customers who find themselves in urgent situations such as when their credit card transaction is rejected, need not worry about having to go through tedious menu options. They will immediately be routed to the bank’s CSOs, skipping all menu options. The CSOs will have all the information related to the event on screen, sparing customers the need to explain their situation, and there is less anxiety on their part. The call menu has also been personalised according to the products a customer holds. Customers with credit cards, for instance, will not hear other banking options, resulting in a shorter menu. The redesigned menu shortens a customer’s time spent on a call by 30 seconds, while customer satisfaction on DBS’ IVR has improved from 3.5 to 4.1 within six months (with 5 being most satisfied). Low said, “Customers are often surprised that the CSOs already know the reasons for their call and that we are able to assist them quickly. For example, if the customer’s card is retained in the ATM, the CSO will be able to see from the screen where the incident happened, and can immediately assure the customer of a replacement.” Voice biometrics and IVR will save DBS customers a significant amount of time given the bank receives more than five million calls each year from its consumer banking customers in Singapore. This is in line with the bank’s belief in making banking convenient for customers so they can live more – that is, do the things that matter to them. Committed to creating joyful banking experiences for its customers, DBS has achieved a number of firsts in digital innovation. In Singapore, customers can log on to digibank, a mobile app, using fingerprint and check their account balance with just one swipe. In April, DBS launched digibank in India, the country’s first mobile-only bank that is branchless, paperless and signatureless. It also combines a set of groundbreaking technology from biometrics to artificial intelligence. Customers can converse with digibank’s AI-driven virtual assistant to get queries answered or banking transactions performed in real time.

They can also get an indication of bank fees instantly with the online indicative fee calculator when they submit their application. More than 1,000 SMEs are expected to benefit from this service in a year. SMEs use banker’s guarantees to secure financial or performance obligations.

SMEs are also sometimes required to provide performance guarantees to support their bids when bidding for contracts or when they apply for government licences.  Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said: “We understand from SMEs that banker’s guarantees are important for their business operations so we adopted the human-centred design discipline to bring this service online, making it easy and fuss-free; from understanding customers’ needs to prototyping possible solutions, developing the solutions in-house, to revamping the entire application and fulfilment process.

Looi Qin En, Co-Founder, Glints Singapore said: “We applied for a DBS banker's guarantee online, and the process was simple, straightforward and fast.

The video stories feature unique individuals whose passion in life speaks to our larger purpose of “Making Banking Joyful” and, in their own way, communicates what it means to “live more, bank less”. The video stories are of Daniel Chong (莊偉忠), ex-CEO of department store chain YATA, Erwin Huang (黃岳永), a serial entrepreneur and leader in the social enterprise eLearning field, celebrity designer  SK Lam, who is the driving force behind local creative studio AllRightsReserved, B.Duck founder and Semk Products Managing Director Eddie Hui (許夏林), Christine Ma-Lau (劉馬露明), who founded a children’s learning centre called Junior Excellent Members of Society (JEMS) and is the eldest daughter of MTR Corporation chairman Frederick Ma, and Rubio Chan and Jamie Cheung, who started North Korea tour organiser GLO Travel. The videos were directed by Ryan Lau, an anchor-turned-director. Glendy Chu, Executive Director and Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “Live more, bank less is about wanting to do something with your life, whether you're in business, raising a family at home, or have a great idea on how to make the world a better place. You want to live life to the fullest and you want simple, smart and innovative banking services and products that enable that. This speaks to the heart of who we are at DBS.” The video stories kick off with Daniel Chong, whose unconventional management style while at the helm of YATA saw much success at the Japanese-themed retail group. “I’ve been through many ups and downs in both business and in life and, through it all, my conscience, sense of humility, and earning the trust and respect of your peers have enabled me to succeed and thrive,” Daniel Chong said. Of his experience directing the video stories, Ryan Lau said, “This documentary-style approach to filmmaking allows me to focus on the story of the individual, their unique characteristics and real events in their lives, to explore the concept of ‘live more, bank less’. With many people in Hong Kong working long hours, there is a need to reevaluate what it really means to live more and to live life to the fullest. I find it inspiring that a bank would espouse what people admire most about successful business leaders.” The “Live more, bank less” campaign in Hong Kong will span across YouTube, Facebook and other digital channels from today until mid-July.

DBS first-quarter net profit rises 6% to SGD 1.20 billion | 简体 | 繁體,03 May 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_quarter_net_profit_rises_6pct_to_SGD_1_20_billion," Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, China, Hong Kong, Regional ","- DBS Group achieved net profit of SGD 1.20 billion for first quarter 2016. Excluding one-time items in prior periods, the earnings were a record and 6% higher than a year ago. Total income also reached a new high, rising 5% to SGD 2.87 billion as net interest income grew 8% to SGD 1.83 billion. Despite heightened risk aversion during the quarter, non-interest income of SGD 1.03 billion was comparable to the quarterly high a year ago, when financial market activities were boosted by favourable central bank policy actions. Asset quality continued to be sound. The non-performing loan rate rose slightly to 1.0% while specific allowances increased 6% to SGD 170 million, both of which were in line with earlier guidance. Allowance coverage of non-performing assets remained healthy at 134% and at 286% if collateral was considered. Return on equity was 11.9%. The results once again demonstrated the resilience of the DBS franchise as it continued to be nimble in capturing opportunities and rigorous in managing risks in a challenging operating environment. Total income growth of 5% from year ago underpins 6% increase in net profit Net interest income rose 8% to SGD 1.83 billion. Loans declined 1% in constant-currency terms to SGD 274 billion. A 23% contraction in trade loans was offset by a 3% increase in non-trade loans from corporate borrowing and a 13% increase in Singapore housing loans. Net interest margin improved 16 basis points to 1.85% in line with higher Singapore dollar interest rates. Non-interest income was 2% lower at SGD 1.03 billion. While fee income rose to a new high, trading income was affected by financial market volatility during the quarter. Net fee income rose 3% to SGD 574 million. Wealth management fees increased 5% to SGD 176 million as bancassurance income grew 63% to SGD 98 million. Card fees rose 12% to SGD 114 million, led by higher credit and debit card transactions in Singapore. Trade and transaction fees were 2% lower at SGD 142 million as growth in cash management offset a decline in trade finance. Fees from investment banking and brokerage also fell in line with market conditions. Other non-interest income declined 7% to SGD 458 million. Trading income fell 12% to SGD 315 million due to lower treasury customer activities. Gains from investment securities also fell. These declines were partially offset by a non-recurring net gain of SGD 38 million in other income. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 19% to SGD 1.02 billion, led by higher contributions from deposits and bancassurance. Institutional Banking income fell 3% to SGD 1.31 billion as growth in cash management was more than offset by declines in trade finance and treasury customer sales. Treasury segment income was 20% lower at SGD 307 million due to less favourable market conditions. Total expenses rose 7% to SGD 1.27 billion. The increase represented a further deceleration in year-on-year cost growth from 10% in the previous quarter and 14% in the first three quarters of 2015. Underpinning the smaller cost increase were a slower growth in headcount and continued improvements in operating efficiency through strategic cost management initiatives. Profit before allowances rose 3% to a new high of SGD 1.60 billion. Specific allowances increased 6% to SGD 170 million. No additional general allowances were taken in view of the healthy cumulative general allowances of SGD 3.2 billion already built up. Net profit rises 20% from the previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, net profit rose 20% as a result of higher non-interest income and a lower cost-income ratio. Net interest income was flat on a day-adjusted basis. Net interest margin was stable at 1.85%. In constant-currency terms, loans contracted 1% as an 11% decline in trade loans was offset by a 1% increase in non-trade loans. Non-interest income increased 29%. Net fee income rose 18% from higher wealth management, loan activities and brokerage fees. Other non-interest income increased 46%, led by higher income from investment securities and other income. Trading income was also higher as treasury customer flows increased from a seasonally-slower fourth quarter. Total income rose 8%, faster than expense growth of 2%. Profit before allowances was 13% higher. Total allowances declined 31% due mainly to the absence of general allowances. Balance sheet remains strong Asset quality continued to be resilient. The non-performing loan rate rose slightly from the previous quarter to 1.0%. The allowance coverage of non-performing assets was healthy at 134% and at 286% if collateral was considered. The average liquidity coverage ratio was 119%, comfortably above the final requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the regulatory requirements due in 2018. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio rose 0.5% points from the previous quarter to 14.0%. The increase resulted from higher retained earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets due mainly to currency translation effects. The leverage ratio was at 7.8%, more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “While we have had a succession of record earnings, this quarter’s performance is particularly satisfying because it was achieved in unusually challenging market conditions. We are proud of the depth and quality of the franchise we have systematically built over the past few years. Our continuing investments in regional businesses and efforts to reinforce risk management, together with a robust balance sheet, put us in a strong position to continue supporting customers and delivering consistent shareholder returns.” [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

"DBS launches India’s first mobile-only bank, heralds ‘WhatsApp moment in banking’",26 Apr 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_Indias_first_mobile_only_bank_heralds_WhatsApp_moment_in_banking," Singapore, India ","- DBS Bank, Singapore’s largest bank and a leading bank in Asia, today officially unveiled digibank, India’s first mobile-only bank. A revolutionary offering, digibank brings together an entire suite of ground-breaking technology – from biometrics to artificial intelligence (AI) – to enable customers to enjoy a whole new way of banking. Breaking away from conventional banking norms with their onerous form-filling and cumbersome processes, digibank is a completely paperless, signatureless and branchless bank. Account-opening can be done easily and effortlessly at an extensive network of outlets run by DBS’ partners; for a start, this includes over 500 cafes across India. Significantly, there is no paperwork involved. Instead, customer authentication is done purely using the Aadhaar card, a biometrics-enabled ID which has been issued to over 1 billion Indians in what is the world’s largest biometric identification programme. Other revolutionary features include: • Customer service provided by a 24x7 AI-driven Virtual Assistant. Wherever they are, whatever their need, digibank customers can converse with digibank’s AI-powered virtual assistant to get their queries answered or banking transactions performed. “What is my account balance?”, “Show me past transactions”, “Pay Amit 100 rupees”. Because the virtual assistant understands natural language and has learning ability, it is able to respond in real-time. Today, it can already anticipate and answer some 10,000 customer questions, with new knowledge added each passing day. This is akin to having a banker at one’s beck and call, without having to speak to a call centre agent. DBS is able to leverage futuristic AI technology to deliver hassle-free banking because of its partnership with US-based fintech Kasisto. In Asia, DBS is the only bank harnessing experimental conversational technology from Kasisto, a spin-off from SRI International which created the technology behind Siri. • An intelligent, intuitive budget optimiser that helps customers be smarter about their money. In-built into digibank is a budget optimiser that helps customers do their budgeting, track expenses and analyse purchasing trends. The function is smart enough to understand customer behaviour and preferences, synthesise data, and provide recommendations. For example, it can make sense of customers’ spending habits to reward them with relevant, contextual marketing offers such as restaurant discounts for a foodie or coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover. It also studies customers’ spending patterns and prompts them if they are overspending. Conversely, if a customer’s savings regularly exceed his or her expenditure, digibank will provide suggestions on how to make one’s money work harder. • Security is enhanced through dynamic inbuilt security, which is safer than OTP.  Recognising that safety is uppermost on consumers’ minds, digibank offers peace of mind through dynamic inbuilt security. Most bank customers are used to receiving One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via SMS, and then typing codes into pages to authorise their mobile banking transactions. digibank has an embedded soft token security, avoiding the need to wait for SMSs to arrive and providing even stronger security for transaction authorisation. Not only does digibank provide hassle-free banking, its more efficient cost structure compared to brick-and-mortar banking allows it to offer better client value: • Account-holders earn 7% interest from the first rupee, one of the highest in the market • Customers enjoy unlimited free cash withdrawals at over 200,000 ATMs nationwide • There are no minimum balance requirements • A physical debit card, which comes with the account, can be used across all Visa-enabled online and point-of-sale transactions, as well as overseas Said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, “India’s banking system is at the cusp of massive change, and as a bank committed to shaping the future of banking, we are excited to roll out a revolutionary, mobile-only bank. With digital, we are able to create a completely different customer experience. What’s more, digibank’s efficiencies and lower costs enable us to pass on significant benefits to customers in the form of greater customer value.” Said Surojit Shome, DBS India CEO, “Among the Singapore banks, DBS has the largest presence in India. This reflects our long-standing commitment and confidence in the market. Over the years, the bank has grown its corporate banking and SME franchise meaningfully. Going forward, we would like to extend our reach in the consumer segment as well. With a billion Aadhaar cards and over 200 million smartphone users in India, the opportunity for growth with digibank is huge.” Said Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys and former chairman of Unique Identification Authority of India, “I am very happy to hear that DBS is launching digibank. I have been a great believer that we are now at the ‘WhatsApp moment of banking’, where paperless, presenceless and cashless transactions are going to completely transform the banking industry. I believe digibank using Aadhaar is a great example of what’s to come.” Said cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, “With multiple commitments, time is at a premium and every minute matters. The simplicity and ease of digibank encourages customers to live more and bank less. DBS is known for values of being trusted and safe which make them a banking partner of choice.” DBS’ efforts to be at the forefront of banking innovation have been widely recognised. The bank was recently named “Best Retail Bank in Asia-Pacific” by The Asian Banker. DBS was lauded as “Trailblazer of the Year, Asia” for the fourth year running, and for “Excellence in Internet Banking, Asia” at the Retail Banking International Awards. It has also been named “Safest Bank in Asia” for seven consecutive years from 2009 – 2015.

DBS inks cross-referral agreements with peer-to-peer lending platforms Funding Societies and MoolahSense,19 Apr 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_inks_cross_referral_agreements_with_peertopeer_lending_platforms_FundingSocieties_and_MoolahSense, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced it has signed cross-referral agreements with peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms Funding Societies and MoolahSense. DBS is the first Singapore bank to collaborate with these lending platforms, expanding the funding sources available to small businesses yet further. The partnership enables DBS to refer some of the smaller businesses that the bank is unable to lend to, to Funding Societies and MoolahSense. In return, the p2p lending platforms will refer borrowers who have completed two successful rounds of fund raising to DBS for larger commercial loans and other financial solutions such as cash management. To safeguard borrowers’ privacy, the bank and p2p lenders will only share information when they have obtained borrowers’ consent in advance. Historically, small businesses without audited accounts and personal income statements tend to be underserved as banks find it difficult to credit assess them. Instead, banks prefer to lend to companies which can provide collateral, have an established operating track record and at least two years of audited accounts. Given its support of the SME sector, over the years, DBS has been expanding the range of solutions it offers to small businesses and now services over 100,000 SMEs in Singapore. The bank has also grown its borrowing base by more than 10% in 2015. Under SPRING Singapore’s Micro Loan Programme (MLP), DBS receives an average of 1,800 SME applications a year. This is more than 50% of all micro loan applications supported by SPRING in Singapore. Hence, DBS accounted for the highest number of loans and loan quantum under the MLP between 2011 and 2015. Last year, the bank also launched a venture debt programme which provides financing to tech start-ups. Its latest p2p partnerships expands the range of alternative funding options further. Said Joyce Tee, Group Head of SME Banking, DBS, “DBS’ partnership with Funding Societies and MoolahSense is a good example of how traditional and alternative finance providers can work together to support the funding needs of small businesses. Such partnerships are becoming common in markets such as the UK and we are pleased to partner two leading p2p lenders in Singapore in this pilot programme.” ""We are honoured to collaborate with DBS, making this the first tie-up in Singapore between a p2p lending platform and an established bank. This is a win-win relationship that helps SMEs gain access to capital at all phases of their growth journey. We are confident that this partnership will greatly benefit both SMEs and investors, bringing more quality opportunities in alternative financing and alternative investment to the society,"" added Kelvin Teo, co-founder, Funding Societies. Lawrence Yong, CEO, MoolahSense said, “As the pioneer platform in marketplace lending, this landmark partnership culminates our early engagement with DBS and sets the stage for deeper collaboration between established financial institutions and emerging fintechs. MoolahSense is honoured to partner DBS, a leading financial institution and a frontrunner in banking innovation. Through this partnership, the funding continuum is being extended with more financing solutions to support the growth of local SMEs – the backbone of our economy.” This latest initiative marks another collaboration between DBS and fintechs. Earlier this year, DBS had also piloted a new way of making credit assessments for small business loans, by working with AMP Credit Technologies to launch a working capital loan for small businesses that accept card payments and have been in operation for at least six months. Instead of relying on financial statements, personal income statements and physical collateral, the joint credit assessment takes into account electronically verifiable cash flows to assess the health of the businesses and their ability to repay.

DBS Marina Regatta 2016 returns with bold new firsts,04 Apr 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_MARINA_REGATTA_2016_RETURNS_WITH_BOLD_NEW_FIRSTS, Singapore ,"- The DBS Marina Regatta is returning with big and bold new experiences on- and off-water. Taking place over two weekends on 28-29 May and 4-5 June, the regatta will witness Singapore and the region’s top dragon boating teams battle it out against the iconic Marina Bay skyline for Asia’s highest prize purse of SGD 230,000. This year’s event will mark the debut of Southeast Asia’s tallest inflatable water slide, and Singapore’s only pop-up urban beach will make an even bigger comeback. Other event firsts include the introduction of themed dragon boat races and competitive kayak races. The regatta will also bring together Singapore’s young homegrown talent, featuring up-and-coming artists, musicians, chefs and change-makers across its expansive range of activities. The DBS Marina Regatta has witnessed rising attendance numbers since its inception in 2012. Said Sim S. Lim, DBS Singapore Country Head, “As the DBS Marina Regatta grows from strength to strength, we aim to continue introducing even more spectacular experiences at the regatta so more Singaporeans can witness for themselves the endless possibilities of the Bay. We hope the activities we have in store will inspire Singaporeans to take a break from work and school and spend some quality time with their family and friends.” He added that over 24,000 people attended the event last year, more than twice the number of attendees in 2012. Watersports in the Bay for all  Organised in partnership with the Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA), this year’s international dragon boat competition will see an estimated 160 crews and more than 3,000 athletes from the region gathering on the waters of Marina Bay to compete for cash prizes totalling SGD 230,000 – the highest for the sport in Asia. More details on the races are available in Annex A. Dr Chia Shi-Lu, President of the SDBA said, “It’s been immensely gratifying to see how much the dragon boating community has grown both in Singapore and the region over the years, and the support from DBS has been instrumental in this. DBS Marina Regatta hosting the SEA Games dragon boat races last year was a pivotal moment, bearing testament to the great strides DBS has made in elevating the sport locally and across the region.” To further broaden the appeal of dragon boating to the masses, DBS Marina Regatta will for the first time, introduce three “theme race” categories. The categories are: • Singapore’s Finest Paddle-off! – For current or past national athletes • Society Gladiators – For participants involved in Singapore-based Voluntary Welfare   Organisations (VWOs) or Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) • Prime Warriors – For participants above 45 years old On 3 June 2016, the regatta will be hosting a kayaking competition for the first time. Held in partnership with the Singapore Canoe Federation, the new kayak fiesta will be open to anyone from kids to competitive paddlers to the physically challenged.  Event goers will also get to try out kayaking or sailing in the Bay during the two weekends with DBS’ 18-metre tall Swedish Match 40 sailboats – the first of its kind in Asia. The sailboats were brought in last year as part of the DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme, which has been offering the public complimentary sailing sessions in the Bay since 2013. Southeast Asia’s tallest inflatable slide meets Singapore’s only pop-up urban beach This year, the Bay will once again be transformed into Singapore’s one and only pop-up urban beach. The beach will come with a packed programme of non-stop activities for families and urbanites alike, from day till night. In the day, the beach pool will hold stand-up paddling and stand-up yoga sessions for board sport enthusiasts, as well as kayaking and zorbing activities for kids. Near the beach, event goers can also get in some adrenaline-pumping fun while contributing to a good cause by tackling Southeast Asia’s tallest-ever inflatable slide – a spectacular 16m, four-storey tall callback to the Big Splash. With unlimited rides available for a single entry fee, all proceeds raised will go to SPD, an organisation that helps people with disabilities develop their potential to the fullest so that they can be self-reliant and independent. The regatta will also bring together a collective of homegrown talent. Situated along the beach, the regatta’s artisan market will offer unique, handmade pieces by Singaporean artists and craftspeople. The stores will be housed in refitted shipping containers that double as viewing decks by night. Over at the food village, young local chefs will serve up innovative fusion meals, with dishes such as salted egg yolk fries and chilli crab ‘man tous’. In the evenings, the viewing decks will make for a breezy al-fresco setting for the regatta’s sunset beach concerts. Featuring a lineup of Singapore’s up-and-coming musicians, the regatta will provide the perfect spot for unwinding with friends and families. Championing social enterprises and encouraging social-consciousness Back by popular demand is “Paddle for Good”, which simulates a dragon boat race, but on land, with the use of indoor ergometer machines. This year, “Paddle for Good” will invite people to attempt the ergometers while challenging the use of their physical abilities so they can experience first-hand what athletes with disability face. For those who successfully complete the challenge, DBS will make a donation to a VWO that supports persons with disabilities.  Last year, the initiative raised more than SGD 150,000 for its beneficiaries. As part of DBS’ continued efforts to champion the development of the social entrepreneurship sector to build a socially-conscious society, a selection of social enterprises under “Asia for Good” by DBS Foundation will feature in the artisan market and food village. “Asia for Good” ( www.asiaforgood.com ) is a first-of-its-kind lifestyle portal that raises the profile of social enterprises in the region with the belief that consumers have the power to create positive change. Bringing the Bay to the people The DBS Marina Regatta is part of the bank’s continuing efforts to engage the community and to share the vibrancy and dynamism of Singapore's new financial downtown with the general public. In 2013, DBS committed SGD 10 million to enliven the Marina Bay area. Last year, the bank renewed this commitment by pledging an additional SGD 12 million over the next three years. From the introduction of the regatta in 2012, DBS/POSB initiatives such as the DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme, POSB PAssion Run for Kids, and its other complimentary cycling and yoga activities have attracted more than 60,000 people to the bay, transforming Marina Bay into a bustling hub of activity.

DBS breaks new ground in digital banking,29 Mar 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_breaks_new_ground_in_digital_banking, Singapore ,"- As Singapore’s largest bank and a leading bank in Asia, DBS is further upping the ante in the innovation space with the official launch of “DBS digibank”, a breakthrough mobile app designed to make banking simpler, smarter and faster for its customers. The new “DBS digibank” app delivers a groundbreaking “mobile-first” experience and builds on the bank’s continuous efforts to innovate on its digital offerings to enhance the customer experience. For the first time in Asia, customers are able to view their account balances with a simple swipe on their mobile devices or Apple Watch. This function, called the “Peek Balance”, does not require any pre-login and customers can choose to “peek” at any of their DBS/POSB deposit or credit card accounts. The “account balance enquiry” function is the most used among DBS’ customers across the bank’s platform, including ATMs, online services and its call centre. The bank went through an extensive customer immersion programme and applied human-centred design in the development of “DBS digibank”. In addition to the mobile app’s enhanced layout and more intuitive navigation, “DBS digibank” also offers customers some of these new features: • Personalised profile and customised quicklinks – Customers can customise their own profiles with a picture or nickname, and can also create shortcuts for their favourite mobile banking services (First in industry) • Payments made easier – Customers can use a list of recent and favourite payees for faster transactions (First in industry) • Instant account opening – Customers can open an additional banking account with just a few simple steps • Touch ID – Customers can log on to their account securely with their fingerprint Said Pearlyn Phau, Deputy Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, DBS Bank, “With increasingly tech-savvy customers and rising smartphone usage, we have designed our digital banking services to be innovative and nimble enough to address customer needs, and be able to provide an intuitive and relevant banking experience. It is about leveraging world-class technology to create a first-class customer experience.” Since its soft launch on 14 March, “DBS digibank” has seen more than 200,000 downloads. DBS currently has the largest number of online banking and mobile banking customers in Singapore with over 2.5 million and 1.25 million users respectively, who account for over 1.2 million transactions daily across its digital platforms. The bank’s customer mobile activity continues to lead the industry in Singapore and mobile banking accounts for over 60% of the bank’s more than 500,000 daily logins. Said Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, “As a bank serving close to five million customers in Singapore, we are upping the ante on not just the breadth of our digital offerings, but also on providing a holistic customer experience across our platforms. We do this by placing ourselves in our customers’ shoes, focusing on their needs and ensuring we know what the real ‘customer job to be done’ is. With ‘DBS digibank’, we seek to seamlessly integrate banking into our customers’ everyday lives so that banking becomes simpler and fuss-free for them.” As the pace of digital adoption increases, the bank is sparing no effort to deliver world class digital offerings to its customers. In December 2015, DBS also piloted digital account opening for new customers. With just a few simple clicks, new-to-bank customers can open savings accounts at their convenience, without having to visit a physical branch.

In 2014, the bank made a commitment to investing SGD 200 million over three years in digital banking regionally and has since rolled out various initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time with their loved ones or doing the things that they care about. Some of these recent initiatives in Singapore include: • DBS PayLah! – A mobile wallet introduced in May 2014 to make peer to peer payments easier, now has more than 300,000 registered wallets. The bank also brought this app to Apple Watch, making it the first wearable bank in Singapore • DBS SMS Banking – In October 2014, DBS introduced SMS Banking, allowing customers to perform simple banking transactions including checking account balances, performing card payments and fund transfers to their own accounts outside of the internet banking environment • DBS FasTrack – A first-of-its-kind app to be introduced by a bank in Singapore in September 2015, it provides a seamless ordering and payments solution for businesses while eliminating or drastically shortening customers’ wait time DBS’ efforts to be at the forefront of banking innovation have also been recognised industry-wide through various accolades, testament to the strides that the bank has made in embracing the digital world.

DBS appoints new head of SME Banking,23 Mar 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_appoints_new_head_of_SME_Banking, Singapore ,"- DBS announced today that Joyce Tee has been appointed Group Head of SME Banking. In this role, Tee will oversee the bank’s SME banking businesses across the region and will report to Jeanette Wong, Head of Institutional Banking Group. Tee will also be the bank’s first female head of its SME banking franchise. Tee started her career providing management consultancy and financial advisory solutions to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the US, working closely with the Small Business Administration and the US Department of Commerce. After spending 12 years in the US, she returned to Singapore and worked with OCBC Bank’s enterprise banking unit for four years, covering the offshore marine and commodities sectors. She joined DBS in 2004 and most recently headed the bank’s shipping, aviation and transportation businesses. Under her leadership, these business lines contributed substantially to the bottomline of the corporate banking franchise. Tee has also built trusted relationships with major industry players, including some of the world’s largest aircraft lessors, who tap on DBS to diversify their funding sources and access the capital markets in Asia. Tee is taking over the reins from Lim Chu Chong, who recently relocated to China to head up DBS’ institutional banking franchise there. In addition to implementing a consistent SME business model across the region, Tee will be focused on leveraging digital innovation to drive client acquisition and deepen existing relationships, as well as further extend support to SMEs in a more challenging economic environment. “Our SME business has gained strong traction in recent years, with the focus on clients and through leveraging technology to make banking simpler and faster for SMEs.

Joyce’s new role will leverage her experience and strengths in many areas including SME banking and industry expertise in shipping and aviation, offshore oil and gas and commodities, to help us continue making DBS the SME bank of choice for many SMEs in Asia.

SMEs can tap on DBS’ business capabilities loan for their restructuring efforts,15 Mar 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/SMEs_can_tap_on_DBS_business_capabilities_loan_for_their_restructuring_efforts_1, Singapore ,"- SMEs in Singapore looking to restructure and build new capabilities will now get a leg up with DBS’ collateral-free business capabilities loan. Specifically designed for SMEs who have successfully applied for government grants, they can tap on DBS’ capabilities loan to cover their expenses incurred prior to grant reimbursement from the respective schemes. SMEs will also enjoy preferential interest rates, as well as annual and early pre-payment fee waivers. The 2014 SME Development Survey by DP Information showed that SMEs have started to embrace the need to restructure their businesses, with just over half saying their main strategy going forward is to rethink their business models. They can tap on government grants, which are designed to defray costs associated with skills upgrading, innovation and productivity related projects, product development, or overseas expansion. However, such reimbursements usually only kick in when a project is completed. The DBS business capabilities loan, acting as bridging finance, can be used to cover project expenses incurred before the SME gets reimbursed. This eliminates the strain on SMEs’ working capital and cash flows, making it easier for them to take the leap in building new capabilities. Joyce Tee, Regional Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said: “We are committed to constantly innovating and helping all our SME customers grow. With the economic outlook getting tougher, we hope that the new DBS capabilities loan will be a cost-effective way to help alleviate the strain on SMEs’ cash flows, thereby encouraging them to embrace innovation and grow new sources of revenue. We are pleased to be able to lend a supporting hand, to help SMEs leverage the wide variety of government grant schemes available.” From 15 March to 30 June 2016, the bank will also waive the SGD1,000 processing fee for all applications.

"DBS launches joyful banking mini-series, Sparks | 繁體",03 Mar 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_joyful_banking_mini_series_Sparks, Hong Kong ,"- There are TV shows about detectives, lawyers and doctors, but no on-screen dramatisation about bankers – until now. In a first, DBS proudly presents Sparks, a three-episode mini-series inspired by a true story. Rolled across DBS’ six key markets in Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong, Sparks communicates how our deep understanding of the world our customers live in, drives the design of our products, services and initiatives to enable our customers to do more of what they want – live. Speaking at the Hong Kong launch, Glendy Chu, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “The customer is at the very heart of what we say and do at DBS Hong Kong, and this resonates in our ability, as bankers, to redefine banking and create an impact beyond banking. Through Sparks, we believe a series about what we do can be engaging, communicate what DBS stands for in a far richer way and build a deeper connection with our audience.” Sparks embodies our larger purpose of “Making Banking Joyful”, where we strive to be a bank that people trust, and a bank that brings joy to customers in their engagement with us. Our efforts are not just in how we execute, but in the spirit in which we execute. It is a purpose that goes beyond banking to bring about customer experiences and outcomes that set us apart. Alex Cheung, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Banking Group, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said, “As a leader in SME banking, DBS Hong Kong understands that the joy of success often comes with long hours and hard work. Having the support of someone you trust, in both the good and not so good times, can help you succeed and spark a more meaningful life. Life is about living and, if DBS can help our customers get more out of life, then we have succeeded in making banking joyful.” Inspired by the true story of a DBS customer, Sparks follows a group of dynamic DBS bankers as they navigate the challenges and opportunities of their work and personal lives. The mini-series offers a seldom seen glimpse into the decision-making processes that banks go through as the bankers work to come together for a customer. Sparks captures that sense of mission, of being easy to deal with, and of being trustworthy, that characterises the way DBS works. The mini-series can be viewed at www.dbs.com/sparks as well as on Facebook and YouTube. In Hong Kong, it is supported by a TVC and an interactive digital campaign. For greater brand reinforcement, retargeting advertising will be employed to further enable our target audience to recall our business and brand. We will leverage traditional media and the TVC to reach multi-screen users and engage them via digital channels. From today until 23 March, the public is invited to play our “Watch & Win” game for a chance to win prizes worth up to HK$3,000 each week! Sparks is directed by renowned director David Tsui and produced by DBS. Shot on location in Hong Kong, including at various DBS Hong Kong premises, the mini-series follows a group of dynamic DBS bankers. They include Claire Lee, the protagonist, played by Hong Kong model Jamie Ha, and her new colleague, a cocky Oxford-educated Jasper Wu, portrayed by singer James Yang. Their superiors are played by Adrian Pang, a veteran actor from Singapore, and Debbie Goh, a Malaysian and Hong Kong actress. Also playing DBS bankers are Nick English, an actor and martial artist, and Aanchal Wadhwani, a fashion designer cum photographer and actress. Other prominent actors also feature in the cast, including father-and-son duo Richard Ng and Carl Ng. Jeanne Lau, who is the daughter of the late martial artist Lau Kar-leung, plays Lindsay, a young entrepreneur with ambitious plans for a solar energy project. As a bank born and bred in Asia, DBS believes in the importance of establishing relationships that provide continuity and stability in an evolving business environment. This is reflected in the long-standing recognition of DBS’ leadership in Hong Kong and across the region. Capping off a year of remarkable results and outstanding performance, DBS was recently named “Asian Bank of the Year” at IFR Asia Awards 2015. DBS was also previously named “Asia’s Best Bank” by The Banker, a member of the Financial Times Group, and “Best Bank in Asia-Pacific” by Global Finance.

Existing travel redemption platform may not fulfil users’ needs | 繁體,25 Feb 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Existing_travel_redemption_platform_may_not_fulfil_users_needs, Hong Kong ,"- Today’s online travel industry generates tremendous excitement whenever it offers discounts or cheap travel products on websites or reward redemption platforms. To learn more about consumer spending and travel habits, DBS Hong Kong commissioned ESDlife to conduct an online survey from December 2015 to January 2016. A total of 611 respondents aged between 25 and 50 participated in the survey and the results were announced today (25 February). The survey findings show that many Hong Kong people love to travel, with the majority of respondents saying that they travel overseas three times a year and spend a total of HK$28,721 per person each year. Some 75% of respondents purchased travel products via online travel agencies or airline websites. This shows that the internet was key to transforming the travel industry and the growing popularity of online travel rewards platforms. Existing travel redemption platforms may not fulfil users’ needs 45% of the respondents said they had used credit card points to redeem mileage and travel products. (Figure 1) Respondents said existing platforms are lacking in a number of areas: availability of budget airline products (87%), flexibility to combine airline tickets and hotel accommodation (79%), a one-stop platform to eliminate the need to log on to multiple websites (70%), the option to top up with cash to reach the required number of points (66%), and instant redemption of mileage using credit card points (59%) (Figure 2). These findings show that the ideal redemption platform should be simple to use, flexible, provide instant redemption, and offer a wide range of travel products. The findings also show that more than half of the respondents (55%) have flown with budget airlines in the past 24 months and 57% of respondents would like to redeem budget airline products via travel rewards platforms. Some respondents resort to extreme measures to redeem travel products or mileage. The survey found that 77% of respondents went out of their way to redeem travel rewards using their credit card points. For instance, 33% of respondents said they applied for more than one credit card, and, in some cases, as many as 10 credit cards, in an attempt to earn more points for the redemption of travel rewards. Some 27% of respondents said they redeemed mileage up to a year in advance, while others constantly monitored mileage information to ensure they get the best rewards (27%). More importantly, 18% of respondents said they spent too much or even bought unnecessary items to earn more credit card points (Figure 3). Local travel expert Lovelovelings commented that the survey results can be attributed to the model of the existing redemption procedures. “To fight for the few airline tickets available on a platform, consumers must earn as much mileage as they can within a short period of time. This forces many consumers to monitor every discount offered by each credit card,” she said. She added that an ideal platform shall include more choices including the popular budget airlines for redemption. She would love to redeem rewards instantly through a mobile device, too. Matthew Driver, group executive, Global Products and Solutions (GP&S), Asia Pacific, for MasterCard, also attended today’s press conference, where he shared key insights on Hong Kong consumers’ attitudes towards international leisure travel. These insights were drawn from the findings of MasterCard’s Consumer Purchasing Priorities survey. Results indicated that 86% of Hong Kong consumers plan to travel in the next 12 months, with 30% of these people intending to travel more this year than last. Research also revealed that Japan (17%), Australia (7%) and London (5%) are Hong Kong consumers’ top three dream travel destinations in the world. iGO Rewards redefining travel rewards DBS Hong Kong today launched iGO Rewards, a new innovative one-stop travel rewards platform that is simple to use, flexible and convenient. iGO Rewards was developed with today’s savvy customers and travellers in mind and took into consideration their evolving behaviours and preferences. With iGO Rewards, users can easily redeem DBS$ for free flights and hotel accommodation as well as create their own travel packages directly on the platform, and there are no blackout dates. iGO Rewards covers all major airlines and over 100,000 hotels globally. As a revolutionary new travel rewards platform, iGO Rewards provides instant e-mail confirmations for bookings, eliminates the hassle of having to log on to multiple websites, and allows users to redeem by topping up their DBS$ with cash if they do not have enough DBS$! During the initial launch period, iGO Rewards can be enjoyed exclusively by DBS MasterCard cardholders.  DBS Black World MasterCard cardholders using DBS$ to redeem travel products can also enjoy an exclusive 45% discount on iGO Rewards. (For more details, please refer to the appendices or visit: go.dbs.com/hk-iGO & https://youtu.be/QJ0mORP7FPg for the video of iGO Rewards.) DBS has been investing considerable resources to drive innovation in digital banking, and iGO Rewards is the latest innovation enabling a joyful, simple and convenient customer experience. “Following the launch of our DBS Omni Credit Card Companion Mobile App, iGO Rewards is yet another innovation that continues to put customers first. It allows users to combine DBS$ and cash to instantly redeem airline tickets and hotel accommodation. It is innovative, flexible and tailored to the needs of Hong Kong’s smart travellers,” Ken Chew, Executive Director, Consumer Finance and eBusiness, at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said. “We believe iGO Rewards will also be attractive to travellers who are not yet fans of air miles, by offering a compelling new reason to apply for DBS credit cards.” iGO Rewards is available on smartphones, computers and tablets.

DBS full-year 2015 net profit rises to record SGD 4.45 billion | 繁體,22 Feb 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_full_year_2015_net_profit_rises_to_record_SGD_4_45_billion," Singapore, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Regional ","- DBS Group’s net profit rose to a record SGD 4.45 billion in 2015. Excluding one-time items, net profit increased 12% to SGD 4.32 billion. Total income crossed the SGD 10 billion mark for the first time, rising 12% to SGD 10.8 billion from higher net interest margin and broad-based non-interest income growth. Return on equity rose from 10.9% to 11.2%. Asset quality was resilient. Specific allowances for loans rose slightly to 19 basis points of loans. The non-performing loan rate was unchanged at 0.9% while allowance coverage of non-performing assets remained healthy at 148%. The performance underscored the breadth and resilience of the DBS franchise as it successfully captured income opportunities and managed risks in a year marked by slower economic growth, financial market volatility and heightened asset quality concerns. Full-year earnings rise 12% Net interest income increased 12% to SGD 7.10 billion. Net interest margin improved nine basis points to 1.77%, the highest in five years, in line with higher Singapore dollar interest rates. Loans grew by a reported 3% to SGD 283 billion due to currency effects; they were little changed in constant-currency terms. Trade loans fell 25% in constant-currency terms. The decline was offset by a 5% constant-currency increase in non-trade loans from higher corporate borrowing and market share gains in Singapore housing loans. Non-interest income grew 12% to SGD 3.69 billion. Net fee income rose 6% to SGD 2.14 billion. Wealth management fees increased 18% as a strong first half more than offset a slower second half when market volatility reduced investment activity. Fees from cards and loan-related activities also rose by double-digit percentages. Transaction banking fees were stable as lower trade-related income was offset by growth in cash management contributions. Investment banking fees fell 25% due to lower equity capital market activities. Other non-interest income grew 21% to SGD 1.54 billion. One-third of the increase was due to higher treasury customer flows. The remainder was mainly from surplus Singapore dollar deposits deployed into US dollar assets through funding swaps. Under accounting rules, interest income derived from funding swaps is accounted for under non-interest income. This effect was more pronounced in the fourth quarter than previously as Singapore dollar interest rates were more elevated. By business unit, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 23% to SGD 3.55 billion, led by higher returns on deposits and wealth management sales. Institutional Banking income increased 7% to SGD 5.29 billion. Higher income from lending activities and cash management was partially offset by lower trade finance income. Treasury segment income increased 3% to SGD 1.14 billion as a strong first half was offset by less favourable market conditions in the second half. Expenses rose 13% to SGD 4.90 billion, with the increase slowing to 10% in the fourth quarter. Excluding currency and one-time effects, full-year underlying expenses were 9% higher and the underlying cost-income ratio was 45%. Profit before allowances grew 11% to SGD 5.89 billion. Total allowances were 11% higher at SGD 743 million. Specific allowances for loans increased 15% to SGD 551 million. General allowances of SGD 121 million were taken, raising cumulative general allowances to SGD 3.22 billion, well above the regulatory minimum. A one-time gain of SGD 136 million was recorded for the disposal of a property investment. Fourth-quarter earnings up 20% from a year ago For the fourth quarter, net profit rose 20% from a year ago to SGD 1.00 billion as total income growth of 13% exceeded a 10% increase in expenses. General allowances of SGD 67 million were taken as a prudent measure. Net interest income increased 11% to SGD 1.85 billion. Net interest margin improved 13 basis points to 1.84% while loans rose by a reported 3%. Non-interest income was 19% higher at SGD 795 million. Net fee income rose 6% to SGD 485 million as growth in most activities was partially offset by lower brokerage fees. Other non-interest income rose 50% to SGD 310 million. Two-thirds of the increase was from interest income derived from funding swaps. Expenses rose 10% to SGD 1.24 billion, led by higher investments in technology. Total allowances increased 17% to SGD 247 million, which included a 24% increase in general allowances to SGD 67 million. Specific allowances were also higher. Fourth-quarter earnings 6% lower than previous quarter Fourth-quarter earnings fell 6% from the previous quarter due to lower non-interest income and higher allowances. Net interest income rose 2%. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 1.84% as Singapore dollar loans continued to be repriced with higher interest rates. Loan volumes were little changed with growth in corporate and housing loans offset by a decline in trade loans. Non-interest income was 12% lower. There had been a gain of SGD 43 million from the sale of properties in Hong Kong in the previous quarter. Net fee income fell 6% as lower contributions from brokerage, loan-related activities and wealth management were partially offset by higher investment banking and card fees. Trading income was little changed. Expenses fell 1% with a decline in staff costs partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. Total allowances rose 39% as general allowances doubled. Balance sheet remains healthy Asset quality continued to be resilient. The non-performing loan rate of 0.9% was unchanged from a year ago and the previous quarter. The allowance coverage of non-performing assets remained healthy at 148% and at 303% if collateral was considered. The average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 122%, which was comfortably above the final requirement of 100% due in 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above regulatory requirements due in 2018. Funding sources were further diversified during the year with an inaugural issue of covered bonds with triple-A ratings. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio rose 0.6% points during the quarter to 13.5% from retained earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio was at 7.3%, more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “The fourth-quarter caps a strong year when total income crossed SGD 10 billion for the first time. The consistency of our performance through the four quarters reflects the quality of our earnings profile. Our balance sheet remains strong: asset quality is robust, allowance coverage is at comfortably high levels and capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. While unsettled financial markets in recent weeks have created short-term uncertainty, the region’s economic fundamentals are sound and the risks associated with slower growth are manageable. Amidst the challenging environment, we are well prepared and enter the year from a position of strength."" The Board proposed a final dividend of 30 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This will bring the full-year dividend to 60 cents per share compared to 58 cents per share a year ago. The scrip dividend scheme will be applicable and scrip dividends will be issued at the average of the closing prices on 5, 6 and 9 May 2016.

DBS RMB Index for Winning Enterprises fell further to 59.1 | 繁體,15 Feb 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_RMB_Index_for_VVinning_Enterprises_fell_further, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited released the fourth-quarter 2015 findings of the DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) today. The index reading dropped further to 59.1 from the previous quarter’s 59.5. Business needs for RMB, including RMB customer orders, invoices and trade settlement, were stable. Fewer local companies expected RMB to depreciate in the next 12 months Far fewer surveyed companies believed that the RMB will continue to depreciate against the USD in the next 12 months (37% in 4Q15 vs. 51% in 3Q15), 35% expected the RMB to depreciate by 2-5%, and only 2% expected the RMB to depreciate by over 5%. However, the survey period, which extended from 22 October to 25 November 2015, could not capture the recent surge in depreciation expectations and subsequent market turmoil. Nathan Chow, Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “Since December 2015, the RMB depreciated 2.7% against the USD. From a technical perspective, further downside risks appear limited in the near-term given the trade-weighted index is now hovering near the floor of its perceived ‘stable’ range. Having said that, the recent RMB slide could exert pressure on other regional currencies; drops in those currencies could lead to second-round effects on the RMB. We expect the RMB will drift towards 6.68 per USD by the end of 3Q16.” Business needs for RMB tipped to decline in the short term, but RMB product use is expected to increase The use of RMB hedging products is generally increasing as large corporates adopt various hedging strategies to mitigate exchange rate volatility. Small- and medium-sized enterprises tend to invoice in RMB because they may not have the experience and/or expertise to hedge foreign exchange risks effectively. Indeed, between 2009 and 2015, the share of RMB-settled cross-border trade rose from almost nothing to 30%. From the survey, fewer respondents (33% in 4Q15 vs. 37% in 3Q15) claimed that they have RMB business needs (RMB customer order/ invoices/ trade settlement) in the next 12 months, while the same percentage of respondents (9% in 4Q15 vs. 9% in 3Q15) claimed they expected to decrease usage in the next 12 months. Meanwhile, the intention to use RMB products in the next 12 months increased, with 44% of respondents intending to use RMB products in next 12 months (vs. 41% in 3Q15). Among companies that use trade services, the intention to use RMB hedging products in the next 12 months also increased (6% vs. 2% in 3Q15). “Since the start of the year, China has been responding to capital outflows with regulations designed to reduce transactions of the RMB in offshore markets. While such regulations seem able to restrain exchange rate volatility, they prolong China’s liberalisation process. In response to the capital restrictions, firms shift transactions back onshore from the offshore market, which has greater liquidity and better infrastructure. This could have a negative impact on the risk-hedging capacity of market participants,” said Nathan Chow. “Furthermore, firms are now hesitant to remit funds onshore after PBoC limited outflows for banks providing yuan cash-pooling services for multinational corporations. The appetite for dim sum bonds is also waning due to the volatile exchange rates and interest rates offshore, evidenced by the fastest ever falling bond issuance amount. As such, balancing the benefits and costs of regulation is a major challenge for Chinese policymakers,” he continued. Most pessimistic business performance outlook since 4Q12 Only 13% (20% in 3Q15) respondents expected improvements in business performance. Similar to the previous quarter, 16% of local companies believe business will slow down by over 10% while more than half of the respondents in the wholesale sector (55% vs. 43% in 3Q15) expected businesses to slow down, and the same can be said for the retail sector (54% vs. 37% in 3Q15). Lily Lo, Assistant Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “Again, the retail market contraction is expected to continue amid a strong HKD, China’s slowdown and the ongoing anti-corruption campaign. All of these are multi-year factors. It is expected that property prices in Hong Kong will drop some 10% by the end of 2016, but a market meltdown is unlikely. Investors should also pay close attention to the city's economic situation and labour market conditions.” DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) offers a strategic tool for policy-makers, businesses and investors to track the actual usage and acceptance of RMB among Hong Kong companies as well as their sentiment towards future RMB adoption. DBS releases the findings of DRIVE on a quarterly basis. Fieldwork for the 4Q 2015 survey was conducted through telephone interviews with the business owners and decision makers of over 200 companies in Hong Kong.

Samir Dixit, Managing Director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific said, “The ASEAN bank brands are on a strong growth trajectory, with DBS leading the ASEAN ranking for the fifth consecutive year. DBS has raised the benchmark for all ASEAN banks by crossing the USD 5 billion brand value mark for the first time and we will see if others follow suit.” “Most Asian banks have achieved significantly high brand strength scores, making them extremely competitive both regionally and globally,” said Alfredo Chandra, Director of Brand Finance Asia Pacific. Since the inception of the study, DBS has been consistently recognised as the most valuable bank brand in Singapore and ASEAN. Karen Ngui, Head of Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, DBS Bank said, “As Singapore’s biggest bank, we are honoured to be able to fly the Singapore flag high once again. Over the years, we have been committed to shaping the future of banking, embracing digital and embedding ourselves in the customer journey. Being recognised as one of the world’s top 50 banking brands spurs us on to making banking simple, smart and effortless for our customers.""

According to figures from the Hong Kong government in 2015, Hong Kong's gross domestic expenditure on R&D increased from HK$7.1 billion in 2001 to HK$15.6 billion in 2013, representing an average annual growth of 7%.

The Policy Address 2016 also stated that, to encourage investment from venture capital funds in local innovation and technology startups, the Government will set aside HK$2 billion to set up an Innovation and Technology Venture Fund for co-investing with private venture capital funds on a matching basis. Technology development is definitely the “must-have” item in town. DBS Foundation recently launched “DBS Social Innovators 2016”  to engage and connect social innovators from different sectors, and to drive social innovation through the use of design and technology.

During the Pitchathon, the startup participants will be guided through their business growth and development with the help of business mentoring from industry and business insiders. Participants will refine their business models within three months. The Pitchathon will conclude with a Final Pitch, where DBS Foundation and the panelists will decide which ideas to support with a granting fund for market launch in the second half of the year. The programme kicks off with a series of Social Talks in collaboration with the SOCTECH series from January to February.

Through a series of IT workshops, over 450 seniors will learn basic computer usage such as introduction to parts of a computer, keyboard and mouse skills and the Windows operating system Held from 15 November to 30 March 2016, the North East Eldersurf Intergen Bootcamp is conducted in both English and Mandarin and led by student cyberguides and volunteers aged 10 to 15 years. The seniors will also learn more about eEntertainment, social media, and email, amongst others. Part of the curriculum is the use of POSB’s self-service banking and SMS banking services, through hands on experience, customised to make banking transactions easier for seniors. Ms. Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director, IDA said, “Technology can be very daunting for seniors, but events like these show how simple and useful it is. What's more, it helps bring families and communities together - which is what life in a Smart Nation is all about - enriching lives and creating opportunities.” The Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage 2014 also indicates that more than half of seniors, who are interested to learn IT skills, first pick it up from family members. Mr. Teo Ser Luck, Mayor of North East District said, “When we initiate a programme, it is always about benefitting our residents. I am glad that both the seniors and the younger generation are involved in this one. Eldersurf promotes picking up new skills while the two generations bond and the best thing to come out of this programme is the appreciation of what each other could offer.” The programme is a collaboration between the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), North East Community Development Council (NE CDC), POSB Bank and participating schools. It was unveiled at the opening ceremony of the POSB White Sands branch which was graced by Guest-of-Honour Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean. Mr. Derrick Goh, Head of POSB said, “The world is becoming more digital and we want to play our part to ensure that our seniors are not left behind. As we promote financial literacy to seniors, we want to also ensure that our elders take full advantage of POSB’s suite of digital banking services so as to enjoy greater convenience. We are glad to support this initiative to help our seniors live life to the fullest.” The 3-hour IT workshops are conducted by professional trainers in groups of 25 senior-student pairs.

POSB rolls out 86 Talking ATMs islandwide for visually impaired customers,13 Jan 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_rolls_out_86_Talking_ATMs_islandwide_for_visually_impaired_customers, Singapore ,"- POSB Bank today announced the launch of “POSB Talking ATMs” in Singapore. Working closely with the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH), the bank has enhanced 86 ATMs across its network to provide visually handicapped friendly functions such as Braille instructions and audio guidance. These new features will help visually impaired customers, including the elderly, perform basic ATM transactions independently. While such ATMs are comparatively more popular across Europe and the United States, Talking ATMs are still a relatively uncommon sight in the region. The POSB Talking ATMs initiative marks the first time a local bank is introducing Talking ATMs in Singapore. With 86 Talking ATMs, POSB now has the largest network of Talking ATMs in Singapore by far. In addition to having a large number of ATMs available to the public, most of POSB’s Talking ATMs will be located at MRT stations to ensure that these ATMs are easy to access. Singapore’s demographics have been changing rapidly over the past few years. 3% of the resident population today have some form of disability. As for the elderly, a number of them suffer from visual impairment as a result of ageing and chronic eye diseases. This number is expected to grow as our population ages. The provision of inclusive services has taken on a greater significance as a result of this. Said Sim S. Lim, DBS Singapore Country Head, “As ‘neighbours first, bankers second’, POSB aims to build a more inclusive society by ensuring that its services are easy to use and takes into account the diverse needs of its customers. The process behind this initiative, from user experience development, testing, piloting and then finally wide-scale implementation took some 1,000 man hours. We worked closely with SAVH to ensure that for the visually handicapped, the process of using these ATMs would be as simple and easy as possible. POSB is thankful to have the opportunity to contribute towards a more inclusive society through our services.” Said Mr. Danny Chia, Vice-President of SAVH, “With POSB providing ATMs with audio features, the visually handicapped person is now able to withdraw cash independently and privately. This eliminates the need to make cash withdrawals over the counter or having a sighted person present to read out the prompts on the screen.” “It is hoped that with the example set by POSB towards making banking more seamless for the visually handicapped, other banks will follow in their footsteps. We applaud DBS for championing the rights of the visually challenged and in helping us take a step forward toward making ours a more inclusive and progressive society.” To activate the audio instruction feature at POSB Talking ATMs, users simply have to plug their headsets into the ATM’s audio jack. This instantly activates the voice instruction feature that will guide users as they perform basic transactions such as balance enquiries or cash withdrawals. POSB Talking ATMs can be identified by Braille indicators or by “Visually Handicapped Friendly” signs on the ATM. Further user instructions in Braille can also be found at key locations across the machine. In addition, POSB has provided a “demo” ATM machine to SAVH. Located at SAVH’s premises, the machine will serve as a training tool to help members get acquainted with the ATM’s visually handicapped friendly functions. The bank is also working with SAVH to develop instruction manuals and train facilitators. Information on POSB Talking ATMs, including usage instructions, is available at posb.com.sg/talking-atms or go.dbs.com/talking-atms . The public can help out by informing friends and loved ones who are visually impaired about the locations of the POSB Talking ATMs or even use the instructions to help familiarise them with the ATMs’ features. Other ways the public can help out include directing visually impaired customers to POSB Talking ATMs – all prominently labelled with the “Visually Handicapped Friendly” sign, if asked.

DBS Foundation launches Asia’s First Social Enterprise-Dedicated Lifestyle Portal,11 Jan 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Foundation_launches_Asias_First_Social_Enterprise_Dedicated_Lifestyle_Portal, Singapore ,"- DBS Foundation today launched its Asia For Good website, a first-of-its-kind lifestyle portal to help social enterprises (SEs) in the region gain greater visibility. The platform enables SEs to showcase their causes and offerings to potential customers. To date, around 200 SEs across Asia have listed their services for free on Asia For Good, raising awareness for their businesses. The portal also features content on conscious consumption, helping to raise the profile of SEs in Asia and connect them with the wider community, potentially leading to new business opportunities. This allows SEs to maximise their reach and marketing effectiveness, and focus their efforts on business and skills development. Members of the public can also discover content around causes they are passionate about, such as helping the disadvantaged and environmental sustainability. According to the 2015 Nielson Global Sustainability Report, over the last two years, consumers are increasingly aware of and willing to pay for socially sustainable goods and services. In 2015, 66% of consumers said that they were willing to support socially conscious businesses, compared to 50% in 2013. This trend was most apparent amongst millenials (those aged 21-34), who were seen as the most responsive to sustainability actions. With conscious consumption on the rise, there has been a gap in the market for a platform that brings together and profiles SEs from various communities, many of which consumers may not have heard of. Asia For Good aims to fill that gap by connecting consumers to SEs in their communities, enabling consumers to make more informed and socially conscious decisions about the way they live and buy. Through its relatable lifestyle content around topics such as food, shopping and travel, Asia For Good hopes to convey the message that consumers can continue to do the things they love to do, but with companies that make a difference. It aims to integrate conscious consumption into consumers’ everyday lives as seamlessly as possible. In addition to SE features and a comprehensive directory listing, the site will also be updated with the latest SE-related events. Said Patsian Low, Head of the DBS Foundation: “Asia For Good is an exciting initiative and we believe it will be a game-changer for SEs in the region. Many SEs that we have worked with say that visibility is one of their major challenges, so Asia For Good addresses that need by telling the SEs’ stories to potential customers. We know that more people want to buy from companies that are making a positive impact. Asia For Good makes it easier for people to locate and engage social enterprises in their communities, as well as to embrace sustainable living.” Since 2010, DBS has worked in partnership with like-minded organisations, as well as the public and social sectors, to promote the development of social entrepreneurship. The DBS Foundation was established in 2014 to enable the bank to provide more dedicated focus to addressing Asia’s evolving social needs. The foundation actively supports and promotes SEs in Asia through the provision of funding, skilled mentoring, training and access to platforms to showcase their businesses. Asia For Good is DBS Foundation’s latest initiative in championing social enterprises in an innovative and different manner.

DBS launches innovative working capital loan for small businesses,11 Jan 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_innovative_working_capital_loan_for_small_businesses, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced the launch of DBS mLoan, a new unsecured working capital loan to help small businesses grow. With DBS mLoan, the bank seeks to plug the credit gap faced by small businesses, which are unable to obtain short-tenor (less than one year) unsecured loans. With DBS mLoan, they can obtain a working capital loan, up to SGD100,000 with no collateral required. Historically, small businesses without audited accounts and personal income statements tend to be underserved as banks find it difficult to credit assess them.  Instead, banks prefer to lend to companies which can provide collateral, have an established operating track record and at least two years of audited accounts. In Singapore, DBS is able to pioneer the provision of credit to these underserved small businesses, because of an innovative new approach it is taking to assess applications and manage credit risk. Working with AMP Credit Technologies, a leading financial technology provider headquartered in Hong Kong, it is able to use electronically verifiable cash flows, such as card payments, to assess each application. These electronic cash flows are studied and measured against sector models of payments and collections and a credit assessment is made accordingly. DBS mLoan is designed for small businesses that accept card payments and have been in operations for at least six months. The application process is simple and fast, with minimal paperwork required. Conveniently for the borrower, repayments are automatically drawn from their existing business bank accounts daily, over a typical loan tenor of three to 12 months. Small businesses in the service industry, such as retailers, restaurants and e-commerce merchants will benefit from this new loan product. They typically need more working capital for a short period of time, such as during the festive season when there is peak demand. Joyce Tee, Regional Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank said: “We are committed to constantly innovating and helping all our SME customers grow, irrespective of their industry or stage of growth. Leveraging advanced credit and data analytics, we are able to design a working capital loan for these small businesses that might otherwise be under-served.” Thomas DeLuca, CEO of AMP Credit Technologies, said: “We are very pleased to be working on this exciting initiative with DBS, which is a frontrunner in innovative thinking. With DBS’ leadership and AMP’s patented platform, Singapore small businesses will finally have an option to obtain working capital that is equitable, transparent and convenient. We look forward to working with DBS for a successful rollout in Singapore and ultimately across the region.” Matthew Gamser, CEO of the SME Finance Forum, which is established by the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, commented: “I am really excited about this new partnership between AMP and DBS.  There has been much talk about alternative lenders and fintechs taking business away from banks. While it is a significant new development in the field of SME finance, it still only represents a very small fraction of the financing going to SMEs.  Far less has been said about innovators using the same alternative approaches in partnership with large banks, combining innovative credit risk and credit process management approaches with the vast untapped potential of the banks’ internal client data resources.  Partnerships such as DBS-AMP demonstrate how joining up banks with fintech can take SME finance much farther, faster than can disruption.” About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS and Manulife officially launch 15-year regional life bancassurance partnership,05 Jan 2016,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Manulife_officially_launch_15_year_regional_life_bancassurance_partnership," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank and Manulife Financial Asia Limited are pleased to announce the official launch of their15-year regional distribution agreement covering Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia. As part of the agreement, effective1January 2016, Manulife will be the key provider of bancassurance solutions to DBS customers in these four markets. The partnership further strengthens DBS’ regional life insurance distribution capabilities, and significantly expands Manulife’s existing successful relationship with DBS. Prior to this, Manulife was already DBS’ main provider of insurance solutions in Hong Kong and Indonesia, and their second largest provider in Asia overall. With the official launch of the partnership, DBS and Manulife have agreed to co-fund up to SGD100 million over the next 15 years to be invested in digital technology and innovation enhancements. Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, DBS Bank, said: “This partnership represents the coming together of two leading organisations, combining DBS’ superior Asian banking franchise with the insurance and wealth management expertise of Manulife, a global leader with a long-term commitment to Asia. With the establishment of the joint fund, we will be able to focus on the development of innovative solutions to serve Asia’s fast-growing consumer base, and help them to fulfil their retirement and insurance needs.” Through this regional life bancassurance partnership, DBS’ six million retail, wealth and SME customers will gain access to Manulife’s best-in-class suite of life and health solutions, across the bank’s extensive network of over 200 branches and its sales force of over 2,000 professionals, as well as via its internet and mobile banking platforms. Roy Gori, President and Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Asia, said: “As a result of this agreement, customers will benefit from DBS’s multi-channel approach, and take advantage of Manulife’s full range of innovative products which are tailored to suit all their financial needs. We look forward to working closely with DBS to secure a safer, better future for customers.” In Singapore, a significant proportion of the population remains under-insured. Close to one in three residents between the ages of 30 and 50 have no life insurance coverage at all [1] . Well-being in retirement is also a growing concern among Singaporeans as the population ages rapidly. Over the last ten years, the percentage of residents above the age of 65 has increased steadily, jumping from 8.1% in 2005 to 11.8% in 2015 [2] . To understand the retirement aspirations and challenges faced by individuals in Asia, the two companies recently conducted a joint research study. The “ DBS-Manulife Retirement Wellness Study ” in Asia aimed to uncover the retirement attitudes, expectations and preparedness among 6,000 pre-retirees [3] in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India Indonesia and Taiwan. The study included a “Retirement Wellness Index”, which measured retirement preparedness among pre-retirees based on three key pillars: namely health, wealth and social aspects. The Index is a weighted average of various attributes across the three pillars, taking into account respondents’ current behaviours and expectations towards retirement, as well as the influence of each attribute. It is calculated on a 100-point scale, with a higher score suggesting better preparation towards retirement. Singapore scored 46 out of 100 points on the index, compared to the regional average of 56 points. Across the three pillars, it scored lowest for the wealth aspect at 35 points, suggesting that Singapore pre-retirees feel less prepared for retirement financially as opposed to the health and social aspects of retirement, which had scores of 54 and 49 points respectively. Other key findings include: • Two in five respondents are not confident about their preparations for retirement • Among those who have started retirement planning, more than half (56%) did not seek any form of advice • Only 36% believe they are able to pursue a comfortable retirement with their savings and investments, while 30% expect that they will have to downgrade their current lifestyle and habits when they retire • 38% are worried about their ability to afford medical costs when they retire, while 32% are unsure about how much to cater for health care in retirement Richard Vargo, Regional Head of Bancassurance, DBS Bank, said, “The ‘DBS-Manulife Retirement Wellness Study’ provides an insightful look into the retirement attitudes and challenges faced by one of the most dynamic regions in the world. Retirement in Asia is a hot issue; populations are aging, workforces are shrinking, and many are underestimating the amount they need to lead the retirement lifestyle that they want. For example, Singaporeans hold high expectations for their retirement years, but many are leaving it too late to make their hopes a reality. We encourage Singaporeans to seek professional advice early to plan and review their options for their retirement.” Naveed Irshad, President and Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Singapore, said: “Financial security is a key building block for a comfortable and happy retirement. Manulife Singapore is committed to helping Singaporeans protect and build their wealth with our comprehensive suite of solutions. By combining our strengths and expertise with DBS, we hope to make a significant difference in improving the retirement lives of Singaporeans, helping them achieve peace of mind in their golden years.” [1] “Protection Gap Study 2012”, 28 August 2012, Life Insurance Association, Singapore [2] “Key Indicators on the Elderly”, September 2015, Department of Statistics, Singapore [3] Covers citizens and permanent residents in these markets between the ages of 40 and 60 Photo: From left to right: Naveed Irshad, President and Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Singapore; Steve Roder, Chief Financial Officer, Manulife; Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management, DBS Bank; Richard Vargo, Regional Head of Bancassurance, DBS Bank [End]  About DBS Bank DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

We look forward to working closely with DBS to secure a safer, better future for customers.” DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited CEO Sebastian Paredes said: “Our partnership with Manulife draws on the distinct strengths of both companies and represents a significant opportunity for DBS to build on and further expand our leadership position among affluent customers and SMEs in this very important market. We’re excited to focus our combined synergies on serving a broader range of customers with leading financial solutions to help them live an enjoyable life with greater peace of mind.” Manulife has been a major bancassurance partner of DBS in Hong Kong since 2009. Michael Huddart, Manulife’s Executive Vice President and General Manager for Greater China, said: “This 15-year agreement with DBS in Hong Kong allows us to gain further access to DBS’ retail, affluent and SME customers in the territory. Through our strong product design capabilities, coupled with DBS’ extensive customer reach, we are able to fulfill their protection and retirement needs and further strengthen our position as the pre-eminent retirement expert in Hong Kong.” To help better identify potential opportunities in Asia’s bancassurance market, DBS and Manulife recently commissioned Nielsen to conduct the inaugural DBS-Manulife Retirement Wellness Study (“Study”) about people’s preparedness for a successful retirement. For Hong Kong, the Study’s findings pointed to an overall retirement wellness reading of 39 points out of 100, based on wealth, health and social-related attributes. This can be attributed to Hong Kong people perceiving themselves as relatively less prepared financially. In terms of health attributes, the Study found that less than one in three respondents are confident that they can afford to pay for their healthcare and medical expenses during retirement. For social attributes, the Study found declining mental alertness or memory loss during retirement to be the top concern among the respondents. “As part of our holistic approach to financial solutions, we are also addressing Hongkongers’ concern over rising healthcare and medical expenses during their retirement,” Mr Huddart continued. “With the combined strength of DBS and Manulife, we will help the bank’s customers protect and build their wealth.” Since 1 January 2016, a comprehensive range of Manulife’s solutions has been available via DBS’ relationship managers and bancassurance specialists.

About DBS - Manulife Retirement Wellness Study in Asia The DBS-Manulife Retirement Wellness Study in Asia represents the views of more than 6,000 pre-retirees on their preparedness and expectations towards retirement. The Study spans six markets: Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, and Taiwan. In Hong Kong, a total of 1,009 Hong Kong citizens, aged 40 to 60 years old, took part in the Study, which was conducted online by research firm, Nielsen, in November 2015. Demographic quotas were set, based on age, gender and monthly household income. This is to ensure national representation in the country. The Study includes a “Retirement Wellness Index” (RWI), which is a weighted average of various attributes across the three key pillars of successful retirement, comprising the health, wealth and social aspects. It takes into account respondents’ current behaviours and expectations towards retirement, as well as the influence of each attribute. The RWI is calculated on a 100-point scale, and the higher the score, the better the preparation towards retirement."
DBS launches new innovative learning centre,10 Dec 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_new_innovative_learning_centre," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank today officially launched the DBS Academy, an innovative learning centre that will focus on building a strong talent pool that will help shape the future of the finance industry. Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam and DBS Chairman Peter Seah officiated at the opening ceremony. Over the last five years, DBS has made significant investments in strategic technology initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time on people or things that they care about. As the digital revolution redefines the banking industry, DBS is also committed to equip employees with the relevant skills and mindsets to help them navigate a fast-changing landscape. Spanning 40,000 square feet, the DBS Academy sets a new benchmark for innovative learning spaces and approaches in the region. Employees will be encouraged to embrace a digital mindset through experiential learning and experimentation. The DBS Academy conducts over 10,000 training sessions each year and employees have access to a wide selection of courses, such as scenario-based leadership development programmes and digital master classes. One of the highlights at the new DBS Academy is the state-of-the-art consumer banking simulation branch where employees will have access to the latest technology that makes banking more seamless for its customers and through hands-on learning, become more familiar with digital tools that can help them deliver greater value to customers. Said Peter Seah, Chairman of DBS Bank, “Over the last 50 years, Singapore has built an impeccable reputation as an Asian financial hub. At DBS, we believe in growing our own talent, developing our people not just for present needs, but for future ones as well. This is not only important for the bank, but for the industry as a whole as competition intensifies. We need to promote continuous learning in order to build a future-ready workforce and a strong talent pool that will help shape the future of DBS and the future of banking.” The DBS Academy takes on special meaning as it is completed in Singapore’s 50th year of independence, furthering the bank’s commitment to help Singapore build on its position as the region’s knowledge hub. The number of training days undertaken by DBS employees has increased by 30% to 133,000 days this year compared to 102,000 days in 2013, above industry standards. In line with the government’s SkillsFuture drive and in the spirit of continuous learning, DBS will also introduce a new programme, “DBS SkillsFlex”, where all Singapore employees ranked Senior Associates and below will receive SGD500 DBS SkillsFlex Credit annually. On top of the 10,000 courses in the SkillsFuture Credit Course Directory, these employees will be able to participate in 50 courses customised for DBS by NTUC Learning Hub. The courses cover topics that are especially relevant to today’s rapidly changing landscape including social intelligence, computational thinking and new media literacy. These initiatives are part of DBS’ holistic approach to people development, promoting continuous learning and an innovative mindset at every level. The DBS Academy is a key component that underscores DBS’ commitment to build a future-ready workforce and a strong talent pool for the finance industry. The push towards creating an innovative mindset among employees is not new for DBS. Since 2010, employees have actively led and participated in projects to simplify banking for customers. To challenge existing models and thinking, DBS was also the first bank to incorporate hackathons into its talent development programme. During the hackathons, employees work with startups to create prototypes that address real business problems. This enables them to gain exposure to the FinTech culture, the agile methodology and other digital working concepts. Employees can also leverage research and analytics experts from A*STAR and SMU in jointly established research labs to develop new and innovative products and services. In September 2015, when the bank launched the DBS HotSpot Pre-accelerator, a three-month programme to help digital startups grow their concepts into prototypes, a group of DBS intrapreneurs were given the opportunity to go on paid sabbatical to work on their prototypes. This year, the bank is also running over 1,000 experiments and prototypes.

DBS RMB Index for Winning Enterprises fell slightly to 59.5 | 繁體,09 Nov 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_RMB_Index_for_VVinning_Enterprises_fell_slightly, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited released the third-quarter 2015 findings of the DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) today. The index reading dropped slightly to 59.5 after reaching its peak at 60.5 in 2Q 2015. Local companies’ business needs for RMB — which includes RMB customer orders/invoices/trade settlement, and their use of RMB payment and receivables, as well as RMB trade services — were stable compared to the previous quarter. However, both business needs for RMB and usage of RMB products are tipped to decline in the short term. Recent RMB depreciation did not have an immediate impact on business needs for RMB and RMB product usage Business needs for RMB is a key indicator of actual RMB acceptance and usage levels at the corporate level. The use of RMB customer orders/invoices/trade settlements in the last 12 months remained stable, despite the recent one-off devaluation of the RMB on 11 August 2015 and the subsequent depreciation that followed in the survey period between 4 August 2015 and 8 September 2015. This can be explained by the time-lag in business decisions. In 3Q 2015, some 29% of respondents said they had RMB customer orders/invoices in the past 12 months, compared with 30% in the previous quarter. The use of RMB trade services was stable at 4%, compared to 5% in 2Q 2015. The percentage of companies using RMB products slightly fell to 28% from 30% in 2Q 2015. Looking ahead, the use of RMB products is generally expected to fall further on the mainland’s economic slowdown. While 37% of respondents said they would use RMB customer orders/invoices/trade settlement in the next 12 months, more respondents (9%) expect a decrease in usage, compared to 7% in 2Q 2015 and 2% in 1Q 2015. Respondents cited the decrease in customer orders from the mainland and the economic slowdown as key factors affecting their decision to decrease usage for the aforementioned purposes in the next 12 months. Worsened business performance and pessimistic business outlook Companies’ business performance has worsened. In 3Q 2015, 40% of respondents claimed that that their business performance slowed down in the past 12 months, versus 32% in 2Q 2015. Wholesale, retail and community, social, and personal services sectors reported deterioration in their business performance, citing economic slowdown as the main reason. The business outlook for the next 12 months was the most pessimistic in three year, or since 4Q 2012 when DRIVE was initiated. Some 40% of respondents believing business performance will worsen, versus 28% in the previous quarter. As much as 16% of respondents believe business will slow down by over 10%. The manufacturing sector fared worst, with 65% of the respondents expecting declines. Some 55% of the respondents in the wholesale sector also expected business to slow down. Surprisingly, the retail sector was relatively optimistic, with over 13% expecting improvement in business performance over the next 12 months. This may be due to expectations that rentals may come down, rather than fundamental improvement in consumer demand. Lily Lo, Assistant Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “Broadly speaking, short-medium term risks in the Hong Kong economy are higher than they have been in the past few years. The retail market contraction is expected to continue amid a strong HKD, China’s slowdown, and the ongoing anti-corruption campaign. All these are multi-year factors. Meanwhile, residential property prices may have reached their peak after more than doubling since the global financial crisis. Although a sudden collapse is unlikely, orderly adjustments would still negatively impact consumer and investor sentiment.” “In terms of factor cost adjustments, retail rents are already coming down, which may explain retailers’ relative optimism, compared to other industries. However, labor costs may adjust more slowly and mildly in comparison. As such, a slew of other sectors, such as business services, import/export, manufacturing and wholesale, remain pessimistic,” Lily Lo said. Local companies expect RMB to depreciate by 2% or more in the next 12 months Over half (51%) of the respondents believed that RMB will continue to depreciate against the USD in the next 12 months, compared with only 20% in 2Q 2015. Some 44% expect the RMB to depreciate by 2-5%. Nathan Chow, Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “The CNY may resume its depreciation after the IMF makes its decision on the SDR, most likely in November.” “Fundamentally, markets are not confident that that China can resolve the “impossible trinity” problem (fixed exchange rate, free flow of capital, independent monetary policy). Doing so requires bold action and clear communication. Today, the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the currency is over-valued and there are grounds for depreciation. This needs to be communicated clearly if authorities decide to allow markets to weaken the exchange rate. The clock is ticking, sentiment is weak and foreign reserves are falling rapidly from the peak of USD 3.99 trillion in June 2014 to 3.51 trillion in September 2015. Resolving the impossible trinity is difficult against the backdrop of a fragile global environment, a cyclical downturn in China and immense challenges from the structural transition,” said Nathan Chow. DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) offers a strategic tool for policy-makers, businesses and investors to track the actual usage and acceptance of RMB among Hong Kong companies as well as their sentiment towards future RMB adoption. DBS releases the findings of DRIVE on a quarterly basis. Fieldwork for the 3Q 2015 survey was conducted through telephone interviews with the business owners and decision makers of over 200 companies in Hong Kong.

DBS/POSB expands banking footprint in Singapore with POSB Cash-Point,05 Nov 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_POSB_expands_banking_footprint_in_Singapore_with_POSB_Cash_point, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced further expansion to its network of withdrawal touchpoints. Customers are now able withdraw up to SGD200 in cash at all Cold Storage, Market Place, Jasons and Giant stores in Singapore. With this expansion, DBS/POSB has effectively increased its POSB Cash-Point locations to around 800 islandwide. Together with DBS/POSB’s ATM network, the bank now has nearly 2,000 withdrawal touchpoints in Singapore – the most for any bank. Named POSB Cash-Point, the complimentary service allows customers to withdraw up to SGD200 (in multiples of SGD10) with any item purchase, using their DBS/POSB debit or credit card linked to a savings account. POSB Cash-Point is already available at Guardian Health & Beauty, Sheng Siong and 7-Eleven stores in Singapore, where customers can withdraw up to SGD100. With DBS/POSB’s latest partnership, POSB Cash-Point has effectively broadened its retailer mix to include supermarkets– a key shopping stop for most customers. For the months of November and December, the first 10,000 customers of each month to withdraw SGD200 or more via POSB Cash-Point will also have an additional SGD10 credited into their accounts.  POSB Cash-Point began in July 2013 when DBS/POSB first announced its partnership with 7-Eleven, allowing customers to make withdrawals at over 400 stores islandwide. This was then extended last year to more than 170 Guardian Health & Beauty and Sheng Siong stores. Customer adoption of POSB Cash-Point has since seen rapid growth. The average number of POSB Cash-Point transactions every month has risen by 115% since 2014, with the average customer withdrawing SGD50 per transaction. The average monthly amount of cash withdrawn via POSB Cash-Points has also grown by 56% since last year.  Since 2011, the bank has also formed strategic alliances with organisations such as SingPost to extend banking beyond traditional touchpoints. Customers are able to withdraw up to SGD5,000 at SingPost outlets and over 63,000 transactions were conducted at SingPost outlets from January to September 2015, up 8% compared to the same period last year.  Mr. Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head of Consumer Banking Group Singapore, DBS Bank said, “Ensuring our customers have convenient and easy access to our services is of paramount importance to DBS/POSB. As we ramp up our digital banking capabilities, we also recognise that our customers value having a ready withdrawal touchpoint nearby when they need cash. With the aim of making banking as convenient as possible, we have chosen to partner with places frequently visited by our customers so the act of withdrawing cash is integrated with part of their daily journey. With POSB Cash-Point, customers need not go out of their way to withdraw money. They can simply make their usual purchases at one of our partners’ stores and withdraw cash in the same transaction – it’s a quick, easy and seamless process.”  Mr. Ruald Swart, CEO of Giant said, “Giant is always looking for ways to add value to our customers when they shop at Giant, be it in terms of savings for their shopping, or services for their convenience. By joining POSB Cash-Point’s network, our customers can now conveniently withdraw cash after they have paid for their groceries, without having to spend time searching for the nearest ATM and queue again, thus saving time for them as well. We are very pleased to be part of this wide network that enhances our customers’ shopping experience with this value-added service.”  Mr. Steven Lye, Chief Operating Officer of 7-Eleven said, “As the first convenience retailer to partner DBS/POSB in the Cash-Point initiative in 2013, 7-Eleven introduced yet another convenient service for fast cash withdrawal at its network of over 400 stores island-wide on a 24/7 basis.

DBS Private Bank is world's most innovative,04 Nov 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Private_Bank_is_worlds_most_innovative, Singapore ,"- DBS Private Bank, the eighth largest player in Asia, has been named the world’s “Most Innovative Private Bank” three times over by the industry’s leading journals. Last month, DBS Private Bank was lauded for having the world’s “Most Innovative Business Model” at the Private Bank International (PBI) Global Wealth Summit & Awards 2015. Global Finance followed by naming DBS as the “Most Innovative Private Bank in the World” in their World’s Best Private Banks Awards for 2015. Finally, in results revealed today in The Banker/Professional Wealth Management’s Global Private Banking Awards 2015, DBS clinched “Best Private Bank in Innovation” – becoming the first Asian bank to win this accolade. Professional Wealth Management (PWM)’s Editor in Chief Yuri Bender said, “We were impressed by the bank's growing reputation in both its Singapore home market and nearby countries in South-East Asia. Particularly important to the judges was the notion that innovation is not seen as a one-off project by DBS, but as part of a continuous automation of all internal processes and a genuine desire to lift the quality of all digital capabilities. Increased scale since the take-over of the Societe Generale Asian banking franchise is alerting much of the private wealth community to the DBS story and our panel of judges believes this is a bank to watch. The innovative move to provide a Big Data solution through a system for relationship managers, powered by IBM Watson, is being closely monitored by rivals, consultants and clients alike.” Since 2010, DBS’ wealth management business – comprising DBS Treasures, DBS Treasures Private Client and DBS Private Bank – has grown consistently by about 20 per cent annually. As at the end of 2014, DBS’ high net worth* AUM and AUM for all wealth customers stood at SGD92 billion and SGD133 billion respectively. From end 2014 to end June 2015, DBS’ wealth management AUM grew 6% and stands at around SGD141 billion today. In 2014, the bank made a commitment to investing SGD 200 million over three years in digital banking and has since rolled out initiatives such as RM Mobility, which provides relationship managers with an integrated mobile platform used to engage customers from the very beginning of their banking experience with DBS. DBS also recently introduced an enhanced version of DBS iWealth, its all-in-one digital wealth management platform. The state-of the-art platform is customisable, provides powerful features and services that allow customers to manage their wealth and stay updated on market trends while on the go. In March 2015, DBS piloted DBS Wealth Adviser powered by IBM Watson with its relationship managers and investment specialists, who are using it to process reams of research and highlight areas of interest, with the aim of boosting their ability to make informed and relevant product recommendations to customers. Said Tan Su Shan, Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management at DBS Bank, “These accolades are testament to the strides we have made in embracing the digital world across the bank and we are thrilled to be recognised as the world’s best in innovation. We are proud to represent DBS and also Singapore on the world stage. The wins are also an endorsement of DBS’ strong culture of innovation and focus on placing the customer at the heart of all we do. We are not staying still and will continue to focus on enhancing the delivery of our financial and banking capabilities to our clients. This includes our initiatives to deliver the next generation client experience in providing advice and the ongoing development of our best-in-class digital wealth platform.” *AUMs from HNWI with more than SGD1.5 million in investible assets [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS third-quarter earnings rise 6% to SGD 1.07 Billion,02 Nov 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_third_quarter_earnings_rise_6pct_to_SGD_1_07_Billion," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Group reported third-quarter earnings of SGD 1.07 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Total income rose 8% to SGD 2.71 billion as net interest income reached a record with net interest margin at a four-year high. Asset quality remained healthy with the non-performing loan rate unchanged at 0.9%. Specific allowances were similar to recent quarters while allowance coverage of 161% was around historical highs. Compared to the previous quarter, total income and profit before allowances were both little changed. An increase in net interest income was offset by a decline in non-interest income. Financial market volatility during the quarter reduced fee income from wealth management and investment banking. Net profit declined 5% due to an increase in general allowances. The results included a charge of SGD 50 million taken to trading income as DBS incorporated funding valuation adjustments to the fair value of over-the-counter derivatives. In doing so, DBS becomes an early adopter in Asia of a newly-instituted industry best practice. Adjusting for the charge, net profit would have been 10% higher than a year ago and stable from the previous quarter. For the nine months, net profit grew 8% to a record SGD 3.45 billion. Improved net interest margin and broad-based non-interest income growth resulted in a 12% increase in total income to SGD 8.14 billion. Excluding one-time items, net profit rose 10% to SGD 3.32 billion. Third-quarter earnings rise 6% from year ago Net interest income increased 13% from a year ago to SGD 1.81 billion. Loans grew by a reported 9% to SGD 285 billion. In constant-currency terms, loans rose 3% as an 8% increase in consumer and non-trade corporate loans was partially offset by a decline in trade loans. Net interest margin increased ten basis points to 1.78%, the highest since second quarter 2011. Net fee income fell 7% to SGD 517 million due to a high base for investment banking fees a year ago. Fees for loan-related activities, cards and stockbroking were higher. Other non-interest income rose 7% to SGD 382 million. Trading income was 6% higher at SGD 286 million as higher corporate customer activities were partially offset by the funding valuation adjustment charge of SGD 50 million. There was also a gain of SGD 43 million from the sale of properties in Hong Kong. Expenses increased 14% to SGD 1.26 billion from headcount growth and investments. Excluding currency translation effects and the one-time impact of acquisitions, underlying expenses were 9% higher. The underlying cost-income ratio was 45%. Total allowances were stable at SGD 178 million. An increase in general allowances from SGD 22 million to SGD 35 million was offset by a moderate decline in specific allowances from 22 basis points of loans to 20 basis points. Third-quarter earnings 5% lower than previous quarter Net interest income rose 4% from the previous quarter. Net interest margin increased three basis points to 1.78% as Singapore-dollar loans were re-priced in line with higher interbank and swap offer rates. In addition, deposit costs in Singapore and Hong Kong were lower as steps were taken to further reduce higher-cost deposits. While loans grew 2% on a reported basis, they fell 1% in constant-currency terms as a 1% increase in non-trade loans was more than offset by a 10% decline in trade loans. Net fee income fell 11%. Volatility in financial markets resulted in lower fee income from wealth management, investment banking and stockbroking activities. Other income increased 5% from higher trading income. Stronger trading gains and corporate customer activities more than offset the charge for funding valuation adjustment. Total income rose slightly while expenses were 3% higher. Profit before allowances was little changed. Total allowances were 30% higher. The increase was due to general allowances, which amounted to SGD 35 million in line with reported loan growth. Specific allowances were stable. Excluding one-time item, nine-month earnings up 10% For the nine months, net interest income rose 13% to SGD 5.25 billion. The increase was due to higher loan volumes as well as a seven basis point improvement in net interest margin to 1.74%. Non-interest income increased 10% to SGD 2.89 billion. Fee income rose 6% to SGD 1.66 billion. The increase was broad-based and led by double-digit percentage growth in wealth management, cards and loan-related activities. Other non-interest income increased 16% to SGD 1.23 billion as trading income performed strongly from favourable positions in foreign exchange as well as from higher customer activities. Total income increased 12% to SGD 8.14 billion. By business segment, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 24% to SGD 2.64 billion, led by improved returns on deposits and higher wealth management sales. Institutional Banking income grew 7% to SGD 4.02 billion. Higher income from lending activities and cash management was partially offset by lower trade finance income. Treasury income from trading rose 4% to SGD 889 million as a strong performance in the first half was moderated in the third quarter. Expenses increased 14% to SGD 3.66 billion. Underlying expenses rose 10% and the underlying cost-income ratio was unchanged at 44%. Profit before allowances increased 10% to SGD 4.48 billion. Total allowances rose 9% to SGD 496 million. An increase in specific allowances was partially offset by lower general allowances in line with the slower loan growth during the nine months. A one-time gain of SGD 136 million was recorded for the nine months from the disposal of a property investment. Balance sheet strength maintained Asset quality remained healthy. The non-performing loan rate was unchanged from recent quarters at 0.9% while allowance coverage was maintained around historical highs at 161%. If collateral was considered, allowance coverage was 324%. Liquidity continued to be strong. Deposits rose by a reported 4% during the quarter to SGD 318 billion, and the loan-deposit ratio of 90% was little changed from the previous quarter. The liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 121%, above the final regulatory minimum of 100% effective 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the requirement due in 2018. Capital remained healthy. While the Common Equity Tier-1 ratio fell 50 basis points to 12.9% due to the payment of interim dividends and to currency translation effects, it remained comfortably above regulatory requirements. The leverage ratio of 7.1% exceeded the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “In a quarter marked by slower regional growth and intense market volatility, the bank’s earnings continued to hold strong. Significantly, net interest margin is at a four-year high. The ability to deliver a solid set of numbers in the face of headwinds testifies to the resilience of the DBS franchise and the soundness of our risk management practices.” [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

DBS Foundation announces inaugural batch of grant recipients,29 Oct 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Foundation_announces_inaugural_batch_of_grant_recipients," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Foundation, the first foundation in Singapore dedicated to championing social entrepreneurship, today announced the recipients of its inaugural Social Enterprise Grant Programme. Eleven social enterprises (SEs) from Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan were awarded grants between SGD 50,000 and SGD 100,000 to grow and develop their initiatives in areas such as healthcare, education and environmental sustainability. The grants enable the SEs to test and create prototypes, improve existing processes or scale up their existing business for greater social impact. They will also join a community of SEs in Asia that the DBS Foundation will actively support and promote. The community can expect support in the form of funding, skilled mentoring, training and access to platforms to showcase their businesses. Said Euleen Goh, Chairperson of the DBS Foundation, “Asia’s social enterprise ecosystem is in its infancy and while there is increasing public support, many social entrepreneurs struggle to grow their businesses due to the lack of structured support.  As a foundation that champions social entrepreneurship and provides social enterprises with relevant mentorship, advisory and funding, DBS Foundation plays a crucial role in helping social enterprises build sustainable businesses that positively impact society.” Since 2010, DBS has worked in partnership with like-minded organisations, as well as the public and social sectors, to promote the development of social entrepreneurship. In 2014, DBS supported close to 20 prominent SE-related events covering almost 10,000 participants in the region, and funded 46 SEs across the bank’s key markets. The DBS Foundation, launched in conjunction with Singapore’s jubilee year (SG50), was established to apply a more structured approach to the bank’s efforts in addressing Asia’s evolving social needs. This year, the DBS Foundation received more than 300 applications for its Social Enterprise Grant Programme, which is part of the foundation’s long-term strategy to directly support SEs. The selection criteria for the programme include social impact, business sustainability and how innovative the proposal is. Said Calvin Chu, Partner at Eden Strategy Institute and an external expert on the Social Enterprise Grant Programme evaluation panel, “I have been involved with DBS Foundation’s initiatives since its inception and have witnessed the development of its programmes. It is rare for a foundation to take such active interest in mentoring and grooming the recipients after the grants have been awarded. I was particularly impressed at the high quality of applications this year and I am confident the grant recipients will make a difference in their communities.” The DBS Foundation has programmes in place to support SEs in three areas of growth. These include:  Reach and Engage : Build awareness and advocacy for SEs through initiatives such as the DBS-NUS Social Venture Challenge Asia, bootcamps, workshops and funding pilot/prototypes.  Innovate and Incubate : Support promising SEs through incubation programmes, mentorship and funding operational growth.  Growth and Scale : Develop high potential SEs and enable success on a regional scale through customised support, advisory and funding.

India and Indonesia are projected to make significant investments over the next few years to increase their power generation capacity so as to meet domestic consumption needs. As the region continues to develop and countries strengthen economic ties with each other, local and cross-border investment in Asia’s power infrastructure is set to grow at an accelerated pace. The introduction of China’s OBOR initiative in 2013 and the establishment of the Silk Road Fund in 2014, to support infrastructure and resource development as well as industrial and economic cooperation, has also boosted the region’s power development. At the DBS Power Conference, participants exchanged views and experiences on the opportunities, challenges and rewards that the OBOR initiative represents to Chinese companies that are considering investing in the region’s power development. Conference speakers also shared innovative financial solutions that maximise capital, capacity and technology efficiencies and insights on how both Chinese and Asian companies can better seize new energy opportunities under the OBOR initiative.

In doing so, DBS becomes an early adopter in Asia of a newly-instituted industry best practice. Adjusting for the charge, net profit would have been 10% higher than a year ago and stable from the previous quarter. For the nine months, net profit grew 8% to a record SGD 3.45 billion. Improved net interest margin and broad-based non-interest income growth resulted in a 12% increase in total income to SGD 8.14 billion. Excluding one-time items, net profit rose 10% to SGD 3.32 billion. hird-quarter earnings rise 6% from year ago Net interest income increased 13% from a year ago to SGD 1.81 billion. Loans grew by a reported 9% to SGD 285 billion. In constant-currency terms, loans rose 3% as an 8% increase in consumer and non-trade corporate loans was partially offset by a decline in trade loans. Net interest margin increased ten basis points to 1.78%, the highest since second quarter 2011. Net fee income fell 7% to SGD 517 million due to a high base for investment banking fees a year ago. Fees for loan-related activities, cards and stockbroking were higher. Other non-interest income rose 7% to SGD 382 million. Trading income was 6% higher at SGD 286 million as higher corporate customer activities were partially offset by the funding valuation adjustment charge of SGD 50 million. There was also a gain of SGD 43 million from the sale of properties in Hong Kong. Expenses increased 14% to SGD 1.26 billion from headcount growth and investments. Excluding currency translation effects and the one-time impact of acquisitions, underlying expenses were 9% higher. The underlying cost-income ratio was 45%. Total allowances were stable at SGD 178 million. An increase in general allowances from SGD 22 million to SGD 35 million was offset by a moderate decline in specific allowances from 22 basis points of loans to 20 basis points. Third-quarter earnings 5% lower than previous quarter Net interest income rose 4% from the previous quarter. Net interest margin increased three basis points to 1.78% as Singapore-dollar loans were re-priced in line with higher interbank and swap offer rates. In addition, deposit costs in Singapore and Hong Kong were lower as steps were taken to further reduce higher-cost deposits. While loans grew 2% on a reported basis, they fell 1% in constant-currency terms as a 1% increase in non-trade loans was more than offset by a 10% decline in trade loans. Net fee income fell 11%. Volatility in financial markets resulted in lower fee income from wealth management, investment banking and stockbroking activities. Other income increased 5% from higher trading income. Stronger trading gains and corporate customer activities more than offset the charge for funding valuation adjustment. Total income rose slightly while expenses were 3% higher. Profit before allowances was little changed. Total allowances were 30% higher. The increase was due to general allowances, which amounted to SGD 35 million in line with reported loan growth. Specific allowances were stable. Excluding one-time item, nine-month earnings up 10% For the nine months, net interest income rose 13% to SGD 5.25 billion. The increase was due to higher loan volumes as well as a seven basis point improvement in net interest margin to 1.74%. Non-interest income increased 10% to SGD 2.89 billion. Fee income rose 6% to SGD 1.66 billion. The increase was broad-based and led by double-digit percentage growth in wealth management, cards and loan-related activities. Other non-interest income increased 16% to SGD 1.23 billion as trading income performed strongly from favourable positions in foreign exchange as well as from higher customer activities. Total income increased 12% to SGD 8.14 billion. By business segment, Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 24% to SGD 2.64 billion, led by improved returns on deposits and higher wealth management sales. Institutional Banking income grew 7% to SGD 4.02 billion. Higher income from lending activities and cash management was partially offset by lower trade finance income. Treasury income from trading rose 4% to SGD 889 million as a strong performance in the first half was moderated in the third quarter. Expenses increased 14% to SGD 3.66 billion. Underlying expenses rose 10% and the underlying cost-income ratio was unchanged at 44%. Profit before allowances increased 10% to SGD 4.48 billion. Total allowances rose 9% to SGD 496 million. An increase in specific allowances was partially offset by lower general allowances in line with the slower loan growth during the nine months. A one-time gain of SGD 136 million was recorded for the nine months from the disposal of a property investment. Balance sheet strength maintained Asset quality remained healthy. The non-performing loan rate was unchanged from recent quarters at 0.9% while allowance coverage was maintained around historical highs at 161%. If collateral was considered, allowance coverage was 324%. Liquidity continued to be strong. Deposits rose by a reported 4% during the quarter to SGD 318 billion, and the loan-deposit ratio of 90% was little changed from the previous quarter. The liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 121%, above the final regulatory minimum of 100% effective 2019. The net stable funding ratio was also above the requirement due in 2018. Capital remained healthy. While the Common Equity Tier-1 ratio fell 50 basis points to 12.9% due to the payment of interim dividends and to currency translation effects, it remained comfortably above regulatory requirements. The leverage ratio of 7.1% exceeded the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “In a quarter marked by slower regional growth and intense market volatility, the bank’s earnings continued to hold strong. Significantly, net interest margin is at a four-year high. The ability to deliver a solid set of numbers in the face of headwinds testifies to the resilience of the DBS franchise and the soundness of our risk management practices.”  About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

Metro Finance and DBS Bank present: “Hong Kong–ASEAN Summit 2015” | 繁體,14 Sep 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Metro_Finance_and_DBS_bank_Hong_Kong_ASEAN_Summit_2015, Hong Kong ,"- As part of China’s wider economic reform effort and determination to go global, the latest “One Belt, One Road” initiative has caught worldwide attention looking for new economic opportunities. The Hong Kong–ASEAN Summit 2015, organised by Metro Finance and sponsored by DBS Bank, was held today (14 September 2015, Monday) to explore the new business opportunities brought by the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, and allow the community to gain a deeper understanding of the current business outlook in Asia. The Hong Kong–ASEAN Summit 2015, themed under “The New ASEAN Economy Under ‘One Belt, One Road”, brought together Consular representatives, trade association leaders and entrepreneurs from Asian countries, as well as Hong Kong’s leaders in political and financial sectors, academia, and experts in economic research, to explore the latest trends in the ASEAN market, international import and export strategies, and the way forward for the global economy. We were honoured to have the presence of The Hon Gregory SO Kam-leung, GBS, JP, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, HKSAR, to deliver the keynote speech at the luncheon and share his visions of Hong Kong’s role under the “One Belt, One Road” policy. The Hong Kong–ASEAN Summit 2015 consisted of speech sessions and group discussions. The summit kicked off with welcome remarks by Ms Bianca MA, Managing Director of Metro Broadcast Corp. Ltd. “China is currently ASEAN’s largest partner of trading, while ASEAN ranks third in China’s list of trade partners, fourth in export markets and second in import origins. With the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative taking place in the near future, China, Hong Kong and ASEAN will undoubtedly be getting closer in many aspects”, said Ms MA in her speech. The Hon Bernard Charnut CHAN, GBS, JP, member of the Executive Council then delivered the opening remarks and shared his insights on how Hong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region, should play the “super-connector” role, connecting China and the ASEAN countries. Dr Jonathan CHOI, GBS, BBS, JP, Permanent Honorary President of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, was the first speaker. He explored, from a SME perspective, the difficulties encountered by local small and medium sized enterprises in running ASEAN business. Dr CHOI also advised how Hong Kong SMEs could leverage Hong Kong’s “super-connector” role to expand into ASEAN. Mr Archie LEUNG Hoi Ming, Expert Committee member of One Belt One Road Forum, then spoke about the strategies for Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macau in face of the opportunities opened up by the “One Belt, One Road” initiative in ASEAN. He pointed out that the three places benefit from China’s “home field advantage” in the ASEAN Economic Belt and should make good use of the opportunities to explore new business. ASEAN countries are not our competitors but mutually beneficial partners in the development of a brand new Asian market. A stable banking system is crucial for corporations going into new markets. In the session that followed, experts including Mr Alex CHEUNG, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Banking Group of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, Mr Raymond YIP, Deputy Executive Director of Hong Kong Trade Development Council, as well as Consular representatives from Singapore and Thailand shared their insights on how ASEAN countries and banks should make themselves mutually beneficial partners under the “One Belt, One Road” initiative. The Summit focused on what various countries could do to equip themselves for the opportunities presented by the new “One Belt, One Road” economy. However, the global economy also presents a significant influence on the ASEAN economic belt. Mr David CARBON, Chief Economist of DBS Bank, examined from a macro perspective, the economic outlook under the US rate hike cycle and the impact of RMB internationalisation on ASEAN development. The final session of the Summit was a group discussion about import/export strategies under global currency war. The strong USD in recent years has impaired Hong Kong’s export, while mainland China’s economic slowdown has weakened Hong Kong’s re-export. On top of this, RMB depreciation took the world by surprise last month. All of these point to the fact that Hong Kong is facing a lot of hidden challenges. Mr Tommy ONG, Managing Director, Head of Wealth Management Solutions, Treasury and Markets (Greater China) of DBS Bank, and Mr Willy LIN, Director of Hong Kong-Thailand Business Council and Vice Chairman of Federation of Hong Kong Industries, discussed various import/export issues and offered forward-looking ideas to the audience. The Hong Kong–ASEAN Summit 2015 concluded with the closing remarks by Mr Alex CHEUNG, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Banking Group of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited. “There is no doubt that the “One Belt, One Road” initiative will unleash one of the most exciting eras of infrastructure development and economic flow along the routes and the peripheral areas. The emphasis on connectivity will also help expedite regional development in Asia and benefit the ASEAN countries, as it unlocks the infrastructure links and removes barriers, facilitating better access for bilateral trade in the region. Given DBS Bank’s extensive network in Asia, we are well positioned to capture the opportunities for our corporate clients, meeting their ‘One Belt, One Road’ specific banking needs with our top-notch services, particularly in strategic consultancy, project finance, and merger and acquisitions,” Mr Cheung remarked. Hong Kong–ASEAN Summit 2015 was organised by Metro Finance, and aimed to explore the potential and importance of ASEAN economic development via discussions, exchange of insights and attempts to preview the future of the global economy. The Summit provided an optimal platform for obtaining up-to-date market information and exploring business opportunities.

DBS is safest bank in Asia for seventh consecutive year,10 Sep 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_is_safest_bank_in_Asia_for_seventh_consecutive_year," Singapore, Regional ","- DBS Bank announced today that it has been named “Safest Bank in Asia” for the seventh consecutive year by leading trade publication Global Finance. The bank also moved up one place to the 11th spot on the global list of safest banks. DBS retained its 2nd place position on the list of World’s Safest Commercial Banks, which comprises financial institutions which are not backed by government guarantees. “The past year has been a rollercoaster for companies and investors, as some of the region’s biggest markets have seen intense volatility and major market changes,” said Joseph Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance. “Geopolitical risk continues to be a concern in regions as diverse as Europe, the Middle East and Asia. This ranking offers companies and investors an objective tool for evaluating the stability and security of the world’s banks—both globally and by region,” Giarraputo notes. Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Bank said, “DBS is honoured to be recognised as the safest bank in Asia for the seventh year running. This year has been marked by slowing growth across the region, and intense market volatility. Despite that, our first-half net profit reached a record high. Topping the Global Finance ranking is testament to the resilience of the franchise, and the strong governance and risk management processes underpinning our business.” Since 1992, the ranking has been a recognised standard of creditworthiness for the financial world. The banks were selected through an evaluation of long-term credit ratings – from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings – and total assets of the 500 largest banks worldwide. DBS’ in-depth knowledge of Asian markets, innovative products, high credit ratings and strong balance sheet have positioned the bank well to grow and capture opportunities in the region. DBS delivered record net profit of SGD 2.39 billion for the first half of 2015. Excluding a one-time gain, net profit rose 12% to SGD 2.25 billion.

The presence of this leading financial institution in our global city will be of great assistance to many businesses both here and in Asia,” Ms Berejiklian said. DBS Chairman Peter Seah said: “Australia was the first nation to establish diplomatic ties with Singapore back in August 1965, nine days after Singapore became independent. Having co-chaired the Singapore Australia Business Alliance Forum back in 1995, I too have enjoyed a long association with Australia. Similarly, DBS is no stranger to Australia, having banked many companies here over the years. All of us in DBS look forward to forging closer ties that will facilitate business growth, both in Australia and across Asia in the years to come.” DBS Chief Executive Officer Piyush Gupta said: “Eight of Australia’s 12 largest trading partners are within Asia, reflecting Australia’s strategic location and increased economic participation with its Asian partners. With our growing footprint in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia, we are better able to connect clients in Australia with Asia and vice-versa, and support them more meaningfully.” Ms Jeanette Wong, DBS Group Head of Institutional Banking, said: “Australia offers many opportunities in the infrastructure, utilities, real estate and commodities sectors and is also a well-established project finance market. DBS has been active in all these sectors and with the new Sydney branch, DBS is now even better positioned to finance such opportunities for our Australian clients, as well as for our Asian clients investing in Australia."" Prior to setting up a physical presence in Australia, DBS covered the region out of its Singapore office, banking blue-chip Asian and Australian corporates as well as financing many  infrastructure transactions including various Public Private Partnership (“PPP”) projects. For example, DBS was mandated lead arranger for Woodside Petroleum’s various syndicated loan facilities to support their business activities in Asia. DBS has also participated in syndicated loan facilities arranged out of Australia for Lend Lease and AV Jennings. In addition, DBS has underwritten and lead arranged syndicated development facilities and debt capital instruments to support Lend Lease investments in Singapore. Aligned to the substantial inflow of investments into Australia, DBS has also supported many Asian and international companies in their Australian investments. DBS has supported Vitol in its acquisition of Shell’s Australian downstream assets, as well as Olam International’s AUD350 million five-year club loan for its Australian entities. In the privatisation space, this included financing the highly successful AUD 1.75 billion privatisation of Port of Newcastle and AUD 5.07 billion privatisation of Port Kembla and Port Botany. Similarly in the PPP space, DBS has been an active participant with numerous award-winning deals such as those for Sydney International Convention Centre, New Royal Adelaide Hospital and New Bendigo Hospital. DBS is consistently ranked among the top 10 project finance advisors and syndicated finance arrangers and bookrunners in Asia by Project Finance International. DBS is a market leader in trade finance in the Asia-Pacific region and has a track record of financing trade flows between Australia and Asia. DBS’ Global Transaction Services business has seen a healthy 18% CAGR since 2009. In 2014, DBS’ net profit rose to a record SGD 4.05 billion. Total income rose 8% to SGD 9.62 billion, with all business segments contributing to the increase. In 1H2015, DBS’ earnings also reached a new high of SGD 2.39 billion.

DBS Bank Is One Of The First Organisations In Singapore To Introduce Two Weeks Paternity Leave,26 Aug 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Bank_Is_One_Of_The_First_Organisations_In_Singapore_To_Introduce_Two_Weeks_Paternity_Leave, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank will be implementing the enhanced paternity leave scheme, which will allow new fathers in the bank to take two weeks of paternity leave, with retrospective effect from January 2015. This is in line with the call by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to extend paternity leave during last Sunday’s National Day Rally. Said Cheong Meng Foong, DBS Group Head of Rewards, “At DBS, people are our most important resource and we have always sought to support them in various ways. The enhanced paternity leave scheme will be a welcome addition to our suite of family-friendly programmes, aimed at promoting work-life balance for our staff. We hope that through these, employees will have more flexibility to better balance their family needs and careers.” Apart from increased paternity leave, the bank already offers various employee benefits aimed at allowing staff to spend more time with their families and to pursue their interests. For example, the bank’s flexible working arrangements enable employees to choose working hours that best meet their individual needs and provide them with the option of working from home. On Fridays, staff can end work at 5pm and they are also entitled to a half day birthday leave during their birthday month. Staff also have a flexible spending account which they can use to fund health and wellness related expenses for the entire family. These are on top of industry standards such as paid childcare and family leave, which are in addition to bank employees’ annual leave. Over the years, DBS Bank and the DBS Staff Union (DBSSU) have worked closely together to enhance staff benefits and to build a better workplace. Ms Nora Kang, President of DBSSU said, “The initiative was announced at the DBS Staff Union 5th Delegates Conference. The union is glad that DBS is able to introduce the enhanced paternity leave scheme in such a short time. By being an early adopter of this national scheme, DBS shows itself as leading the way in staff welfare. We hope this will encourage more companies to step up in support of national efforts to strengthen family-friendly work environments.” [End] About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets.

The bank was also named Best Wealth Manager in Singapore, China and Indonesia, three of its key markets. Ms Tan Su Shan, DBS’ Group Head of Consumer Banking and Wealth Management, was honoured as Private Banker of the Year, Singapore. According to The Asset, DBS won the coveted Best Wealth Manager in Asia award because of “the bank’s ability to recognise the different requirements of both new and established clients, as well as provide wealth management solutions and services through DBS Treasures and DBS Treasures Private Client”. DBS has three platforms catering to affluent individuals: DBS Treasures, DBS Treasures Private Client and DBS Private Bank. It launched DBS Treasures Private Client in September 2011 to cater to the needs of individuals between mass affluent and Private Banking clients, with AUM of SGD 1.5 million to SGD 5 million. The platform was created given DBS’ recognition that different wealth creators value different products and services, prompting the bank to design distinct value propositions to suit their needs.

Today, the franchise accounts for about 11% of DBS’ total income. In 2014, DBS’ income reached a record SGD 9.62 billion. Including one-time items, net profit was SGD 4.05 billion.

Said Royce Teo, Regional Head of DBS Treasures and DBS Treasures Private Client, “Over the years, we have made significant strides in our DBS Treasures and DBS Treasures Private Client franchise. The bank has invested in an Asia-centric client proposition, providing deep Asia insights and wide connectivity, a full suite of customised products and services, as well as a cutting-edge digital proposition to customers.

DBS RMB Index for Winning Enterprises rose to record high of 60.5 in 2Q 2015 | 繁體,11 Aug 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_RMB_Index_for_Winning_Enterprises_rose_to_record_high, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited is pleased to release the second-quarter 2015 findings of the DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) today. The index reading rose to a record high of 60.5 from the previous quarter’s 55.1, as the business needs and usage of RMB increased among local companies. Business needs and usage of RMB rebounded in 2Q 2015 Business needs for RMB, measured in terms of the use of RMB customer orders/ invoices, is a key indicator of actual RMB acceptance and usage levels at the corporate level. In 2Q 2015, 31% of local companies surveyed said that they had RMB customer orders/ invoices in the past 12 months, representing an 8% increase from 23% in the previous quarter. Some 36% said that they would use RMB for these purposes in the next 12 months, up from 32% in 1Q 2015. The percentage of companies using RMB products rose to 30% in 2Q 2015 from 27% in the previous quarter. Some 25% of companies said they are currently using or will consider using RMB deposits in the next 12 months, versus 24% in 1Q 2015. Those that said they are currently using or will consider using RMB trade services in the next 12 months also increased to 6% from 5% in the previous quarter. Deteriorated business performance and outlook The rebound occurred despite the fact that actual business performance and business outlook both deteriorated over this period. Companies’ business performance has worsened persistently since 2Q 2014. Citing economic slowdown as the main reason, manufacturing, retail, community and personal services sectors reported deterioration in their business performance in 2Q 2015. Business outlook for the next 12 months also deteriorated, with 28% of respondents believing business performance will worsen, from only 18% in the previous quarter. The manufacturing sector fared worst, with more than half of the respondents expecting declines. Positive correlation between appreciation expectations & business needs for RMB There is a generally positive correlation between appreciation expectations and business needs for RMB over the course of our study. In 2Q 2015, appreciation expectations made a comeback and business needs for RMB increased in tandem. Nathan Chow, Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “Despite the State Council recently announced that the RMB will be allowed to trade in a wider range against the dollar, greater price swings are not expected in the near term. On one hand, Beijing will likely keep its currency relatively stable at a time when China’s weakening economic growth is fanning fears of capital flight. On the other hand, by keeping the RMB largely stable, China could further promote the cross-border use of the currency.” Recent stock market rout has limited impact on the internationalisation of RMB Nathan Chow said: “The recent stock market debacle should not derail Beijing’s attempt to internationalise the RMB. The internationalisation of a currency is the process of promoting its use outside the home country. This process can be grouped into three categories: 1) Currency being used as a pricing and invoicing currency; 2) used as financing and investment tool; and 3) adopted as a reserve currency. For the RMB, encouraging development was seen in all these fronts.” The proportion of China’s trade settled in RMB has already surged to 25% from 3% in 2010. Inward and outward direct investments that were settled in RMB have ballooned by 850% and 830%, respectively, over the past three years. The offshore RMB bond market has doubled in size each year since 2008. Its outstanding volume (including Certificates of Deposit) reached approximately 700 billion yuan as of July 2015. “More importantly, many foreign reserves managers are showing an increasing appetite for the currency. To date, around 50-60 central banks, sovereign institutions, and supranationals have invested in the RMB. All these reflect the fact that the Chinese Yuan is now perceived as a relatively more mature currency,” Nathan Chow said. DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) offers a strategic tool for policy-makers, businesses and investors to track the actual usage and acceptance of RMB among Hong Kong companies as well as their sentiment towards future RMB adoption. DBS releases the findings of DRIVE on a quarterly basis. Fieldwork for the 2Q 2015 survey was conducted through telephone interviews with the business owners and decision makers of over 200 companies in Hong Kong.

DBS pioneers online loans application service for SMEs,05 Aug 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_pioneers_online_loans_application_service_for_SMEs, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced a groundbreaking initiative which enables SME owners to apply for up to 11 types of loan products [1] -- business loans, import and export financing and even business credit cards  online, with no signatures required. They can also track the application real time and get instant notifications on the loan processing. This first-of-its-kind service in Singapore brings greater convenience to time-strapped SMEs. Today, across the banking industry, when SME owners apply for loans, they have to handwrite and sign on physical forms. DBS has made the entire application process paperless and signatures are no longer required, which is an industry first. The application forms have also been redesigned with simple, jargon-free language, and the number of fields to be completed has been reduced by 76%, to expedite the application process to only 10 minutes online. DBS also linked its backend system to information obtained from Account and Corporate Regulatory Authority’s database via a service provider to pre-populate loan application forms to save SME owners’ time. For example, when applying for government assisted loans such as the SPRING micro loan programme, SME owners currently have to complete two forms, a DBS loan application form and the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) form. Under DBS’ new loan application service, the two forms have been combined into one and repetitive fields have been eliminated. According to SPRING data, DBS is Singapore’s largest provider of micro-loans for young start-ups, micro and small enterprises since 2011. The bank receives an average of 1,500 micro-loans applications a year, which is more than 60% of all micro-loans applications supported by SPRING in Singapore. The moment an application is submitted online, the information is channeled into the bank’s credit scoring engine, where quick, accurate and consistent loan decisions can be made, using Big Data with proprietary algorithms. Customers can track their applications real time and follow their applications through the credit decisioning process. This new system will also automatically update SME owners when their loan applications have reached critical stages such as when their application is received, approved etc. This new feature was introduced based on feedback from SME owners. Initial customer feedback has been positive. Mr Loke Kit Kai, Director and Owner, Acceltus Pte Ltd said: “The application process was smooth with step-by-step instructions that were easy to follow.

DBS Accelerator is a collaborative initiative between DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited and Nest, the leading Hong Kong-based startup incubator and full-service ecosystem, and aims to create opportunities for innovators from across Asia and around the world to shape the future of banking and finance. The intensive accelerator programme is housed in “The Vault”, a newly renovated and state-of-the-art 5,000-square foot workspace in the heart of Wan Chai, and the participating startups will have access to vast resources and mentor support. The 10 startups taking part in this year’s DBS Accelerator are Tofu Pay, Currenxie, Apvera, Creditable, Dollar$mart, Monexo, Fund Innovation, Xfers, Closir and Super Fluid. They were selected from nearly 140 applicants from around the world and will be guided through their business growth and development with the help of business mentoring from DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited and Nest senior executives as well as other partners. Each participant will refine their business model under the accelerator programme, which concludes with DBS and Nest Demo Days and a Public Investor Demo Day, where their ideas can find support to further scale up. DBS Bank (Hong Kong)’s Managing Director, Head of Technology & Operations, Hong Kong & Mainland China, David Lynch, said, “We are extremely pleased with the quality and diversity of the applications we received. Clearly, FinTech is attracting a new wave of talent and entrepreneurial thinking. Industry mega trends, such as cloud computing, mobility and wearable technology, the Internet of Things and data science, are unlocking the potential to create new business models and ecosystems. It's energising to see how many high potential startups are moving into the space. We’re committed to being an active participant in shaping the future of banking. The chosen startups for the programme all show strong potential to succeed in their respective domains, as well as to help us transform.” Nest CEO Simon Squibb said, “Through this programme, DBS has become one of Asia’s leading players in the evolution of the finance industry.

DBS issues Singapore’s inaugural covered bonds,30 Jul 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_issues_Singapores_inaugural_covered_bonds, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today successfully priced the issue of USD1 billion fixed rate covered bonds due 2018, DBS’s first issue under its USD 10 billion Global Covered Bond Programme established on 16 June 2015. The covered bonds will bear a fixed coupon of 1.625% per annum payable semi-annually in arrear, equal to a spread of 37 basis points over mid-swaps, well below the level for new senior unsecured USD debt issues by bank issuers of similar rating to DBS. The competitive pricing of this issue follows the announcement of the group’s strong first half 2015 financial results and a successful roadshow in Asia, Europe and the United States. DBS was also granted the ECBC Covered Bond Label on 29 June 2015. This quality label was the first granted by The Covered Bond Label Foundation to an issuer outside the European Economic Area, and further enhanced visibility of DBS’s covered bond initiative to global investors. The issue attracted orders of approximately USD1.37 billion from over 40 investors, with banks anchoring the order book and accounting for 62% of orders. Orders were received across 16 countries with a high level of representation from Asia at 51%. DBS Chief Financial Officer Chng Sok Hui said, “We are very pleased with the strong interest received from global investors in our first covered bond issuance, which allowed us to price at tight spreads even under current difficult bond market conditions. With the issue, we have been able to engage a fresh group of investors, and access liquidity with greater cost efficiency, lowering our overall funding cost.” “This inaugural issuance is a milestone for the Singapore covered bond market and it paves the way for greater participation in the future by investors and issuers in this new asset class. As the largest bank in Singapore and a leading bank in Asia, we are proud to have taken the lead in opening up this market.”  DBS, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale were mandated as Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners, and Barclays and Citibank as Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners for the issue. The issue is expected to be rated Aaa/AAA by Moody's and Fitch. Covered bonds are rated higher than senior unsecured debt as investors have recourse to both the issuer and a portfolio of mortgage loans and other assets. The expected Aaa/AAA ratings would allow banks to hold DBS’s covered bonds as high quality liquid assets and count towards Basel’s liquidity coverage ratio requirement.

POSB National School Savings Campaign popular with the community,05 Jun 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_National_School_Savings_Campaign_popular_with_the_community, Singapore ,"- Since its launch in January this year, the POSB National School Savings Campaign has garnered strong support from the community, with close to 200,000 stamps sold and over 5,000 stamp cards completed and deposited. With the support from the Ministry of Education and participating school bookstores, POSB has now achieved 100% participation from all 190 primary schools in Singapore to participate in this iconic campaign. Some schools like Henry Park Primary School, Hong Wen School and Innova Primary School have even requested for POSB to open bank accounts for their students so that students are able to take monitor and manage their own finances. “We are really encouraged by the strong response from the schools community to the POSB National School Savings Campaign. Within just five months of the launch, we have received positive feedback from parents, teachers and even students themselves. As we have designed the format of the campaign to be fun and interactive, students are motivated to collect the savings stamps and complete the stamp cards, essentially participating in the physical act of saving money,” said Jeremy Soo, Head of DBS Singapore Consumer Banking Group. “The POSB National School Savings Campaign is very effective in enhancing students’ social and emotional competencies like self-management and self-awareness. In self-management, students manage their pocket money effectively through budgeting and set aside some for savings. In self-awareness, they understand that their spending and saving habits have an impact on their lifestyles. After participating in this campaign, students understand the importance of savings and they also learn that savings is more important than a want,” said Ho Wei Heong, Level Head of Character and Citizenship Education at Wellington Primary School. Joshua Lee, father of student Caleb Lee, said, “The programme provided the perfect platform for me to bond, educate and inculcate good saving habits for my son. His desire to collect stamps stems from filling up the card quickly so that he can ‘scan’ for bonus stamps in the Smiley Town game. I noticed he has started to display enthusiasm and effort in thinking before spending – something which has never happened before.” A student participating in this campaign purchases about three stamps a week, on average, saving SGD 1.50 in the process. The average balance for POSBkids accounts has also increased by 13% from a year ago, reflecting the effectiveness of this campaign in promoting the savings culture among children. Over the last few months, POSB has done a series of school outreach activities led by the bank’s mascot, Smiley the Squirrel, to inculcate the values of savings and thrift among students. To further engage the digitally savvy generation of today, POSB also launched “Smiley Town”, a mobile gaming app which provides students with money saving tips and helps students track their savings. To further reach out to the community, POSB is also working with Sengkang West Division to launch a financial literacy programme for children by leveraging on the National School Savings Campaign. POSB has released its latest stamp designs – the “sports” series – to commemorate the 28th SEA Games happening in Singapore from 5-16 June. (Refer to attachments for stamp designs) To participate in the POSB National School Savings Campaign, students can collect stamp cards from participating school bookstores, POSB/DBS branches, or any SingPost outlet. They can purchase stamps (at SGD 0.50 each) from participating school bookstores or SingPost outlets. Once the cards are filled with 20 stamps, they can be deposited into any POSB/DBS Quick Cheque Deposit location, and SGD 10 will be subsequently credited into the student’s POSBkids account. To provide greater incentive for students to save, POSB will offer a bonus SGD 1 for every SGD 10 saved by each student per month via this campaign. The campaign will conclude at the end of November this year.

Singapore’s largest online marketplace Qoo10.sg taps mobile wallet DBS Paylah,04 Jun 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Singapores_largest_online_marketplace_Qoo10_sg_taps_mobile_wallet_DBS_Paylah, Singapore ,"- For the first time, the largest local online marketplace Qoo10.sg has signed on a mobile wallet as a payment option for its customers. From mid-June onwards, customers shopping on Qoo10.sg will be able to pay for their purchases using DBS PayLah!, the fastest-growing personal mobile wallet in Singapore. The move by Qoo10.sg to tap on DBS PayLah! reflects how readily Singaporeans have embraced mobile technology and how e/m commerce firms are adjusting to this rapid change. According to Google’s Consumer Barometer research in 2014, Singapore has the highest rate of smartphone penetration globally, and this move by Qoo10.sg further underlines the mobile-first trend, where smartphone adoption has leapfrogged computer adoption. Increasingly, Singaporeans are using their mobiles to purchase items like flight tickets, apparel and cinema tickets among many others. As customers become increasingly tech savvy, they are also demanding a more integrated experience on their mobiles. The partnership between DBS and Qoo10.sg will simplify the process for customers making payment via their mobiles. With only one or two clicks, customers are able to pay from their DBS PayLah! mobile wallet quickly and securely. Mobile banking usage among Singaporeans also continues to grow strongly in line with the penetration of smartphones. In just five years, the number of DBS mBanking users recently crossed the one million mark while it took around 10 years for its iBanking users to reach that number. More than 50% of the bank’s daily digital transactions are being done via mobile devices and DBS currently has over 2.2 million iBanking users. Mr. Gene Wong, Executive Director of Regional eBusiness, Consumer Banking Group, DBS Bank said, “With more than 240,000 users, DBS PayLah! is the fastest-growing mobile wallet in Singapore. As the penetration of smartphones continues to deepen in Singapore, businesses are paying close attention to this trend, with many adopting a mobile-first mindset. As such, merchants are also keen to adopt DBS PayLah! to keep pace with their customers and stay relevant in the rapidly changing mobile landscape in Singapore. We are pleased to further expand our platform to them. Our aim is to make the entire mobile payment journey as seamless and intuitive as possible for all.” “Qoo10.sg is the largest online marketplace in Singapore, and we are seeing 50% of our customers coming in through the mobile app. With more than 20,000 transactions per day on the mobile, partnering with DBS PayLah! is an exciting step for us to enable a fully mobile experience that ultimately will drive better user experience and more transactions for us and DBS,” said Mr. Hyun Wook Cho, Country Manager of Qoo10 Singapore. DBS PayLah! is also enabling SMEs in Singapore to provide a more convenient payment option for their customers. BusOnlineTicket.com is one such SME, which is dedicated to providing long distance express bus services within the region. “The bulk of our customers at BusOnlineTicket.com are tech-savvy Singaporeans. Having a payment method like DBS PayLah! that is trusted and widely recognised can help to further boost our business and sales,” said Mr. Winston W., CEO of BusOnlineTicket.com. From June onwards, to make a payment to Qoo10.sg and BusOnlineTicket.com, customers simply have to select DBS PayLah! as a payment method. They will then be redirected to login at the DBS PayLah! app to review the details of their payment, and approve the payment. Customers are then returned to the merchant site or app to complete their order. In a move to drive greater mobile payment usage across the country, DBS has also made DBS PayLah! available to all Singapore residents, regardless of whether they are DBS/POSB customers. “With DBS PayLah!, we have now reached a critical mass and that is why we are also expanding this service to all residents in Singapore as consumers have signalled their readiness to adopt mobile payments,” said Wong. At this year’s DBS Marina Regatta happening over three weekends from 30 May to 14 June, DBS PayLah! will also be offered as a payment option for event-goers buying food and drinks at the DBS Food Village by Savour. When DBS PayLah! is selected as the payment option, customers only need to enter their phone numbers at the kiosks. They will then get a notification on their DBS PayLah! app to complete the payment on their mobile phones. About DBS PayLah! DBS PayLah! is a mobile wallet app available for  Apple iOS and Android platforms. It is the fastest-growing personal mobile wallet in Singapore, and has more than 240,000 users since its launch in May 2014. The mobile wallet allows customers to send money instantly to either a single individual or a group of recipients via mobile numbers. Customers can also request for money from others, pay bills to 35 different billing organisations and donate money to 14 charities. DBS PayLah! also has a special “eAng Bao” feature – the first in Singapore – and saw more than 10,000 transactions being made over the Lunar New Year period. While all users can access their DBS PayLah! mobile wallet with a personal password, customers on selected Apple devices may also login with Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The ability to login with Touch ID was introduced in DBS PayLah! in October 2014 – a first for a Singapore banking app. As of today, more than 40% of logins are being made through the feature. DBS PayLah! is also open to non-DBS/POSB customers. By simply downloading the DBS Paylah! mobile app for free from Google Play Store or iTunes App Store, non-DBS/POSB customers can then link and verify their bank accounts to create their mobile wallets. Customers can then send and receive money to and from other DBS PayLah! users using only the recipient’s mobile phone number, instead of needing their bank account information. Non-DBS/POSB customers can also withdraw their funds from their DBS PayLah! wallet to their linked bank accounts instantly. Now, DBS PayLah! can be used at e/m-commerce merchants as well. Customers simply select DBS PayLah! as a payment option and they will be redirected to the DBS PayLah! app to log in, review the details of their payment, and approve the payment, all within two clicks.

DBS ramps up commitment to Marina Bay with SGD 12 Million pledge,25 May 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_ramps_up_commitment_to_Marina_Bay_with_SGD_12_million_pledge, Singapore ,"- In 2013, after DBS Bank announced its intent to commit SGD 10 million over three years to enliven Marina Bay, the bank proceeded to introduce a slew of activities to attract people from all walks of life to the bay. With the burgeoning success of these community initiatives and in response to public demand, DBS will now commit a further SGD 12 million over the next three years to ignite even more possibilities at the bay. With community programmes such as DBS Movies by the Bay, the DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme and POSB PAssion Run for Kids, DBS’ initiatives have since attracted more than 60,000 people to the bay. Marina Bay today has been transformed into a bustling and vibrant hub of activity, host to marquee events such as the annual DBS Marina Regatta and the upcoming 28th SEA Games. Said Karen Ngui, Managing Director and Head of Group Strategic Marketing and Communications at DBS Bank, “Many of us do not realise that the Marina Bay area and where DBS’ headquarters is located today is on land that simply used to be open sea. Marina Bay is an amazing metaphor for how Singapore has transformed within one generation. It represents the Singapore spirit – what we have achieved and what we can achieve together in the future.” “When we made our commitment to enlivening the Bay in 2013, we set out to bring community programmes to the public that would encourage them to see and experience all the Bay has to offer. It’s been an exciting and invigorating three years, and with our increased SGD 12 million commitment for the next three years, we look forward to sparking more joyful experiences.” DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme expanded to feature first-of-its-kind sailboats in Asia Launched in 2013, the DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme offered the public the rare opportunity of sailing in the waters of the Marina Reservoir and enjoying its scenery from a different perspective. More than 7,500 people have enjoyed complimentary trips on the eight DBS sailboats around the Marina Bay. Despite DBS increasing the frequency of the highly-popular initiative from an initial monthly affair to a fortnightly one, sailing slots continued to be snapped up within minutes of being released. The DBS sailboats swiftly became a common and iconic sight at the Bay. As part of the bank’s commitment to providing the public with new and singular experiences at the Bay, DBS will be expanding its fleet of sailboats to include six Swedish Match 40 sailboats – the region’s first. Imported from Europe, and built for elite racing and training, this is the first time such boats are being brought to the region. This means that members of the public will soon be able to sail in the same boats used by the world’s top sailors in competitions such as the prestigious America’s Cup – which is widely considered to be the Formula One of sailing. This one-of-its-kind experience will be available from early July 2015, with each boat able to take 12 people. With the combined fleet of 14 sail boats, in all, close to 20,000 people will be able to sail in the Bay each year. Said Karen Ngui, “These sailboats reach an impressive height of 18 metres, or five stories. With the enhanced programme, Singaporeans will be able to take the wheel and steer these vessels through the heart of the Marina Bay for the first time – all for free. It’s an exclusive and unique experience that we want to make available to anyone and everyone. ” Other initiatives that will continue include the DBS Marina Regatta, DBS Movies by the Bay and POSB PAssion Run for Kids, and the bank may also introduce other new experiences. The bank’s sustained effort towards bringing unique and innovative initiatives to the bay is all the more meaningful as the nation looks to the future. DBS Marina Regatta – Igniting possibilities by the Bay First launched in 2012, Singapore’s biggest watersports festival brought international dragon boat competitions back to Singapore after a 12-year hiatus and has become a marquee regional festival for top dragon boat teams in the region. This year, the DBS Marina Regatta 2015 is set to be the biggest ever and will be held over three explosive weekends.

DBS first quarter net profit rises to record SGD 1.27 billion | 繁體 | 简体,27 Apr 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_quarter_net_profit_rises_to_record_SGD_1_27_billion," Regional, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan ","- DBS Group’s net profit for first-quarter 2015 rose to a record SGD 1.27 billion. Excluding one-time items of SGD 136 million, net profit increased 10% to SGD 1.13 billion. Total income grew 12% to SGD 2.74 billion as net interest income and non-interest income both reached new highs. The growth was broad-based across all business units. Compared to the previous quarter, net profit before one-time items increased 35%, led by higher non-interest income. Return on equity was 12.2%. Net profit growth of 10% from year ago underpinned by 12% rise in total income Net interest income increased 14% to SGD 1.69 billion. Loans grew by a reported 11% to SGD 281 billion; in constant-currency terms, loan growth was 6%. An increase in regional corporate borrowing and secured consumer loans was partially offset by a decline in trade loans. Net interest margin increased three basis points to 1.69%. Non-interest income crossed SGD 1 billion for the first time, rising 9% to SGD 1.05 billion. Fee income increased 10% to SGD 560 million. Wealth management contributions rose 43% from higher unit trust and insurance sales while fees from credit and debit cards increased 23%, reflecting a continuing strengthening of the wealth management and consumer banking franchises. Other fee segments were generally maintained at the previous year’s levels. Other non-interest income grew 7% to SGD 486 million as DBS was well positioned during a quarter marked by monetary easing by various central banks. While trading income of SGD 356 million was similar to first-quarter 2014, it was significantly higher than recent quarters as a result of favourable positions in foreign exchange and interest rates. Income from investment securities tripled to SGD 103 million as profits were realised on government securities. Income from treasury customer flows of SGD 335 million was comparable to the strong year-ago levels. All business units achieved record income. Consumer Banking / Wealth Management income rose 29% to SGD 861 million, with the Wealth Management segment growing 41% to SGD 365 million. Institutional Banking income was 5% higher at SGD 1.35 billion while Treasury income increased 38% to SGD 386 million. Total expenses increased 13%, in line with income growth, to SGD 1.18 billion. The cost-income ratio was at 43%. Profit before allowances rose 10% to SGD 1.56 billion. Total allowances were 20% higher at SGD 181 million. Specific allowances for loans of SGD 151 million or 22 basis points of loans were higher than a year ago but similar to recent quarters. General allowances of SGD 21 million were lower than a year ago. There was a one-time gain of SGD 136 million during the quarter from the disposal of a property investment in Hong Kong. Net profit rises 35% from the previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, net interest income increased 1%. Loans increased by a reported 2% but were little changed in constant-currency terms. While regional corporate and secured consumer loans grew, trade loans fell in line with lower commodity prices and an industry decline in China-related trade finance volumes. Net interest margin eased two basis points from 1.71% in the previous quarter to 1.69%. The underlying margin was stable. The effect of higher SGD rates was offset by a lower average loan-deposit ratio as trade loans declined. Non-interest income was 57% higher. Fee income increased 22%. The growth was broad-based and led by higher contributions from wealth management and lending activities. Trading income was four times the previous quarter’s seasonally-low levels. Total income increased 17% while expenses were 5% higher. Profit before allowances rose 28%. Total allowances were 14% lower. Specific allowances for loans were little changed while general allowances declined in line with loan growth. Balance sheet remains strong Asset quality remained healthy. The non-performing loan rate was unchanged from the previous quarter at 0.9%. Allowance coverage of non-performing assets of 161% was around historical highs and was at 294% if collateral was considered. Liquidity remained ample to support growth and meet contingencies. Deposits rose 2% during the quarter and 8% over the previous 12 months to SGD 324 billion. The loan-deposit ratio was at 87%. The SGD and all-currency liquidity coverage ratios were at 424% and 131%, above the respective regulatory requirements of 100% and 60%. DBS was also well-capitalised. The Common Equity Tier-1 ratio of 13.4% and total capital adequacy ratio of 15.3% were both above regulatory requirements. The leverage ratio of 7.1% was more than twice the minimum of 3% currently envisaged by the Basel Committee. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “DBS started the year on a solid footing, with strong all-round performance yet again. Despite a slowdown in trade volumes, the bank’s first-quarter earnings reached a record high. This is testament to the strength and resilience of the DBS franchise. We will continue to grow our business, while keeping a watchful eye on the economy.” About DBS DBS - Living, Breathing Asia DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 250 branches across 17 markets.

DBS and Manulife form 15-year regional life bancassurance partnership,08 Apr 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_and_Manulife_form_15_year_regional_life_bancassurance_partnership, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank Ltd and Manulife Financial Asia Limited are pleased to announce that they have entered into a 15-year regional distribution agreement covering four mutually significant markets, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia. The agreement signed today will take effect on 1 January 2016. This new exclusive life bancassurance partnership will combine DBS’ superior Asian banking franchise with the insurance and wealth management expertise of Manulife, a global leader with a long-term commitment to Asia. In the four markets, DBS’ large and growing six million retail, wealth and SME customer base will gain access to Manulife’s best-in-class suite of life and health insurance solutions, through the bank’s extensive network of over 200 branches and its sales force of over 2,000 professionals, as well as via its internet and mobile banking platforms. Leading to the agreement with Manulife, DBS conducted a thorough insurance partner selection process, which attracted strong interest from a number of leading regional and multinational insurers. The process considered a number of factors, including customer focus, expertise, execution track record and potential for long term value creation. Manulife is a leading provider of insurance and wealth management solutions. It is the sixth largest [1] life insurer in the world, with a 118-year track record in Asia, and more than six million customers across 12 markets in the region. Manulife first established a presence in Singapore in 1898 and is the leading life insurance provider of retirement and wealth solutions in Hong Kong [2] , where it established operations in 1897. The partnership is expected to bring significant benefits to both parties: DBS will further strengthen its regional life insurance distribution capabilities, including its position as a leading bancassurer in Singapore, while providing its customers with a full suite of innovative and customised insurance solutions. Manulife will gain exclusive access to DBS customers in four highly attractive insurance markets, which remain significantly under-insured with a sizeable insurance protection gap and underfunded retirement needs. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said: “Bancassurance is a key focus for DBS and an important part of our overall customer value proposition. Manulife’s strong customer focus and deep commitment to Asia are aligned with our own vision. We are already working with Manulife in Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, and will soon be their flagship regional bancassurance partner and their largest bancassurance partner globally. Together, we look forward to building upon the momentum we have achieved in bancassurance.” Manulife President and Chief Executive Officer, Donald A. Guloien, said: “We are delighted to be chosen as the bancassurance partner of DBS in four important markets in Asia.  DBS is a great organisation, with a great track record and a very bright future. We know DBS well, and want to be an integral part of their continued success as a leading financial services group in Asia. This 15-year agreement builds on our existing successful relationship with DBS. It accelerates our growth in Asia, deepens and diversifies our insurance business, and gives us access to a much wider range of customers.” Domenic Fuda, Deputy Group Head of Consumer Banking & Wealth Management at DBS, said: “We are delighted to partner with Manulife, a leading global insurer in Asia. We see many complementary opportunities to provide various leading protection and savings products to our customers, helping individuals and families achieve peace of mind when it comes to health coverage and retirement savings."" Roy Gori, President and Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Asia, said: “The strength and vision of DBS and Manulife are highly complementary, particularly our shared focus on providing an extraordinary experience for our customers. DBS offers highly attractive distribution capabilities, an extensive customer base, and proven bancassurance capabilities.  We are excited by the prospect of expanding our relationship.” Under the agreement, there will be an initial payment by Manulife to DBS of USD 1.2 billion [3] , which Manulife intends to fund with internal resources. This payment will be amortised by both parties over 15 years. There will also be ongoing, variable payments, which are based on the success of the partnership, and Manulife expects the agreement to be accretive to Core EPS in 2017.

DBS Marina Regatta 2015 ignites the bay with the 28th SEA Games,08 Apr 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_Marina_Regatta_2015_ignites_the_bay_with_the_28th_SEA_Games, Singapore ,"- The DBS Marina Regatta is back, and this time, it is bigger and better than ever. This year’s regatta holds special significance as it: Joins DBS Marina Regatta with the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games to bring the best of the region’s sailing and dragon boating teams to Marina Bay in celebration of SG50 Spans three weekends, enabling even more people to join in the fun. Each weekend will offer something different for the community, including those who live and work around the bay, sports enthusiasts and families. Brings trendy, meaningful and fun experiences to Marina Bay including the ""Paddle for Good"" initiative to support inclusive sports and raise funds for the community, transforming the Promontory into an urban beach with pop-up cafes, conducting urban farming workshops and stand up yoga classes. Organised in partnership with the Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA), the 2015 edition of DBS Marina Regatta will see an estimated 2,500 paddlers take to the bay to compete in exhilarating races across nine categories for SGD 215,000 in prize money – Asia’s highest – as they power their way through the same waters that will host the region’s best at the SEA Games in subsequent weekends. Weekend 1 (30-31 May) – Paddle for Good DBS brought international dragon boat competitions back to Singapore after a 12-year hiatus with the inaugural DBS Marina Regatta in 2012. The regatta has become a marquee event, synonymous with dragon boating, and this year, more than 200 races are anticipated. DBS Marina Regatta’s open and women races will be held on 30 and 31 May. Beyond the dragon boat races, Singapore’s biggest watersports festival will feature an even more diverse range of activities designed to appeal to more varied interests. One of the regatta’s key aims is to unify everybody, regardless of one’s background and physical abilities, with the vision of a more inclusive society, through sports. To this end, the event will debut “Paddle for Good” on 30 May where the public are challenged to form teams with and paddle alongside persons with disabilities (PwDs). “Paddle for Good” simulates a dragon boat race, but on land, with the use of indoor ergometer machines instead of boats. For every one kilometre paddled, DBS will donate SGD 100 to organisations that will use the funds to organise sports activities for PwDs. Donations will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the Care and Share movement led by Community Chest. The event will also, for the first time, include urban farming workshops to teach people how to farm sustainably in their homes. An estimated 5,000 attendees – comprising DBS employees, Social Enterprises, Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) and their family members – are expected to attend during that weekend. Said Sim S. Lim, DBS Singapore Country Head, “As we celebrate Singapore’s 50th year of independence, we are proud to showcase DBS Marina Regatta and the 28th SEA Games races at one of our nation’s most iconic locations. Marina Bay, a space that did not exist just 11 years ago, has undergone a radical transformation. Today, it is a vibrant and dynamic place that has ignited countless possibilities and is a testament to the vision of our late founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who first conceived of the Marina Bay back in 1987. We hope to build on his legacy by making the bay a place for everyone to enjoy.” In addition, on 29 May, to further nurture young athletes and promote dragon boating, the annual National Inter-Schools’ Dragon Boat Championship, which is open to all secondary school and junior college students, will be held at the Marina Bay for the first time. Weekend 2 (6-7 June) – Best of Southeast Asia Dragon Boating For the first time in almost 22 years, the SEA Games is back in Singapore. The SEA Games’ Traditional Boat Races (Dragon Boat Races) will take place at the Marina Bay and race viewing will be free of charge. The races will comprise 12-crew and six-crew men and women categories, with the six-crew boats making their worldwide debut. With the DBS Marina Regatta’s mixed dragon boat teams and the SEA Games’ races being held in the same weekend and in the same waters, the weekend promises to be a showcase of the best in Southeast Asian dragon boating talent, with paddlers exhibiting grit, resilience and endurance amid fierce competition. National dragon boat teams expected to compete include Indonesia, the reigning Asian Games champion, making the SEA Games a must-watch for everyone. Mr. John P. McGrath, Senior Vice President of the SDBA said, “The DBS Marina Regatta has contributed largely to the revitalisation of dragon boating throughout Asia. Over the last four years, the DBS Marina Regatta has helped to develop dragon boaters in the region by giving them the opportunity and the platform to measure themselves against one another. That the DBS Marina Regatta is being held in conjunction with the SEA Games’ Traditional Boat Races (Dragon Boat Races) this year is testament to the growth of the sport in Singapore.” Weekend 3 (13-14 June) – SEA Games Sailing @ the Urban Beach During the DBS Marina Regatta’s final weekend of festivities, DBS seeks to ignite possibilities at the bay by transforming the Promontory into Singapore’s first urban beach by the bay. Eclectic offerings such as pop-up cafes, stand-up yoga and paddling are more reasons for people to visit Singapore’s new downtown. The weekend will also have the SEA Games’ Sailing teams competing by the bay, providing even more impetus for the public to come and enjoy the unique experience of lounging by a beach while watching world-class sailing teams compete for gold. DBS Marina Regatta 2015 will once more feature popular events such as the Regatta Cosplay Challenge, the Asian Food Festival and the Asian Drum Challenge. The well-received DBS Dragon Tap will also return with more fun features such as “Challenge a Friend”. Leading up to the regatta, the bank will also showcase cinemagraphs by Singapore’s popular street photographers that capture their perspectives of the DBS Marina Regatta. In 2013, DBS committed SGD 10 million over three years to enliven the Marina Bay area. Since then, through initiatives such as the DBS Marina Regatta, the bank has enabled more than 50,000 people to enjoy different facets of the bay. For example, members of the public get to sail around the bay with the DBS Marina Bay Sailing Programme, enjoy outdoor cinema with DBS Movies by the Bay, as well as cycling and yoga activities by the bay – all complimentary events organised by the bank.

DBS first in Singapore to incorporate hackathons into its talent development programme,01 Apr 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_first_in_Singapore_to_incorporate_hackathons_into_its_talent_development_programme, Singapore ,"- DBS has initiated a brand new approach to hackathons. At the DBS MegaHackathon last week, the bank brought together 150 DBS employees and startups from around the region to tackle business and societal challenges. This makes DBS the first organisation in Singapore to build hackathons into its talent development programme, with employees creating prototypes alongside startups. This initiative by DBS is driven by a desire to create a more digital mindset among its employees. The hackathon serves as a sandbox for employees to experiment like a startup, utilising lean startup methodology and human-centred design to identify and act on opportunities quickly. It also provides startups with the opportunity to interact with like-minded peers, understand business realities and showcase their capabilities. Today, technology drives 99% of DBS’ interactions with its customers, and with more FinTechs entering the traditional banking space, the digital agenda is a key priority for the bank. In addition to building technology infrastructure to support a more nimble organisation, DBS is also focused on making sure staff embrace innovation. Said Dave Gledhill, Head of Group Technology & Operations at DBS: “Our industry is seeing an unprecedented pace of change and if we wish to remain relevant to our customers, our employees must embrace a culture of innovation and be intrapreneurs. At events such as the DBS MegaHackathon, our employees and startups can benefit from each other’s knowledge and expertise, as well as have a cultural exchange. This fresh approach to hackathons has generated a number of viable working prototypes for the bank. We believe it will also help shape the startup ecosystem in Singapore by creating business opportunities for them.” By making innovation a key focus of its talent development programme, DBS is also equipping its employees with skills and knowledge to shape the future of banking. Said Lee Yan Hong, Head of Group Human Resources at DBS: “We are committed to providing opportunities for our employees to learn, develop and excel in their careers. As the bank embarks on its digital journey, it is essential for us to innovate and find new ways to groom the next generation of digitally-minded leaders through exposure, education and experiential learning.” The five-day DBS MegaHackathon took place from 23-27 March at Block 79, Ayer Rajah, part of the newly expanded JTC Launchpad @ One-North startup cluster. The event kicked off with a two-day workshop to help DBS employees adopt a digital mindset and an outside-in approach to the customer journey. This was followed by a three-day hackathon where bank staff and startups teamed up to create 19 prototype mobile apps to better engage customers in an increasingly mobile world. Judges at the DBS MegaHackathon included DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, DBS Chief Innovation Officer Neal Cross, DBS Head of Group Human Resources Lee Yan Hong and Venture Capitalist Jeffrey Paine. The three winning startups walked away with prizes of SGD 8,000, SGD 6,000 and SGD 4,000 respectively, while the rest were awarded SGD 2,000 each. (For details on challenges and winners, please see Appendix A and B ) The bank piloted its first hackathon in Singapore last October and has organised three more, including the DBS MegaHackathon, since then. More than 250 DBS employees and 160 startup members across the region have participated in the hackathons to co-create 50 prototypes.

DBS delivers customised digital solution for seamless connectivity for Manulife in Hong Kong | 繁體,18 Mar 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_delivers_customised_digital_solution_for_seamless_connectivity_for_Manulife_in_Hong_Kong, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited today announced that it has successfully implemented SWIFTNet-FileAct connectivity with Manulife (International) Ltd (“Manulife”) in Hong Kong. This new capability provides a highly customised digital solution to serve as the major delivery channel to process insurance premium collections. “We are very pleased and proud to be able to bring this leading solution to Manulife. DBS’ customised solution reinforces our strong relationship with Manulife and clearly positions DBS among the few global cash management providers to support financial institutions and large corporates with this kind of robust and scalable digital platform. “Insurance is a rapidly growing market and the successful implementation of DBS’ SWIFTNet-FileAct connectivity with Manulife is a demonstration of the flexibility and innovation that DBS continues to bring to this market. A combination of highly specialised skills, flexibility and a deep and thorough understanding of Manulife’s objectives contributed to the success of this project,” Soh Kian Tiong, Head of Financial Institutions, Government Linked Corporations, Institutional Banking Group, at DBS Bank, said. “DBS’ transaction banking business has been one of our strategic priorities since 2010 and, with our customised solution for Manulife, we are taking a further step forward to help clients achieve greater efficiencies and business growth,” Sohfern Boey, Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said. Implementing SWIFTNet-FileAct connectivity for corporates and non-bank financial institutions provides a highly secure, reliable and cost-effective way to transfer large volumes of data in different formats, including mass payment information, business-critical files, documents, images and other data, around the world. With this connectivity, Manulife can obtain financial services from DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited via a single, highly secure, and standardised communication platform. The highly customised solution also enables Manulife to achieve straight-through processing and standardisation in the channel delivery mechanism as well as reporting that is suited to its needs. The standardised platform has helped Manulife reduce IT development costs, save time in integrating with different bank systems, and enhance the overall customer experience. DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited also further improved the Direct Debit Authorisation delivery to the SWIFTNet-FileAct connectivity to enhance process automation. As much of the Direct Debit Authorisation setup process in Hong Kong is still done manually with paper documentation, this sophisticated automated solution builds the foundation for the smooth and seamless handling of increasing Direct Debit Authorisation volumes in future. DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited seamlessly developed and implemented the SWIFTNet-FileAct connectivity to support Manulife’s new treasury system, which uses SWIFTNet-FileAct as the major delivery channel for its bulk transactional activities. A special DBS taskforce was formed to coordinate and work with Manulife’s Toronto-based technology team and successfully performed four weeks of comprehensive testing to ensure the system’s operational integrity.

DBS pioneers virtual account opening service for SMEs,17 Mar 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_pioneers_virtual_account_opening_service_for_SMEs, Singapore ,"- DBS Bank today announced a groundbreaking initiative which enables SME owners to open business accounts virtually. This first-of-its-kind service in Singapore brings greater convenience to time-strapped SMEs by shifting what was previously done at a branch to the virtual world. Today, across the banking industry, SMEs have to meet with a relationship manager (RM) or a branch teller to complete the process of opening a business bank account. With DBS’ virtual account opening initiative, this is now unnecessary. Instead, SMEs can complete the application by speaking to their RM through mobile or tablet video applications such as FaceTime and Skype. RMs will verify the customers’ particulars and complete their applications virtually, just as they would at the bank branch. This complements an earlier online account opening service (OAOS) launched by DBS in December 2013. With OAOS, DBS has linked its backend systems to information obtained from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority’s database via a service provider. This allows the bank to pre-populate account opening forms on behalf of the customer online, saving the SME owner time and also eliminating the need for unnecessary form-filling and data entry work. After completing the application form online, instead of making a branch appointment, SME owners, who are new to the bank, can now opt to complete their application virtually. Existing retail and corporate DBS customers have the option of completing the application process through a phone call instead. This virtual account opening initiative is the latest in a slew of initiatives by DBS to bring greater convenience and value to customers through digital banking, and to shape the future of banking. Said Lim Chu Chong, Regional Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank, “With our SME customers becoming more tech savvy, since the launch of the OAOS service, we have seen a steady increase in the number of business accounts opened online. Today, over a third of DBS’ new business accounts are opened via this online service. By enhancing this with a virtual component, our customers can gain greater flexibility and make better use of their time. We are constantly innovating and looking to improve the customer experience, making banking for SMEs simpler, smarter and more social.” The virtual account opening service is available to Singapore registered businesses that are operating entities in Singapore. New business account customers who sign up from 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2015 will enjoy fee waivers on DBS’ corporate internet banking platform, DBS IDEAL™. These waivers apply to set-up fees and monthly subscription fees. Last October, DBS also rolled out DBS BusinessClass, a programme which offers start-ups and SMEs valuable resources, including a unique mobile platform through which they can consult and connect with industry experts, investors and fellow entrepreneurs. More than 8,500 entrepreneurs have signed up as members to tap on the wisdom and experience of 30 seasoned industry veterans.

DBS/POSB – First bank in Singapore to introduce SMS queue system in all full-service branches,25 Feb 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_POSB_First_bank_in_Singapore_to_introduce_SMS_queue_system_in_all_full_service_branches, Singapore ,"- As part of DBS/POSB’s continuous effort to deliver an enhanced customer banking experience, the bank today announced the official launch of its SMS queue system – also known as the SMS ‘Q’ – across all its branches. The system, which has been piloted in selected branches since July 2014, is the first to be introduced by a bank in Singapore and will be rolled out to all full-service DBS/POSB branches by the end of March 2015. DBS/POSB will also be replacing traditional standing queues with seats so customers may await their turn in comfort. The SMS ‘Q’ service allows customers to request for a queue number via SMS prior to visiting DBS/POSB branches and receive notifications on the number of customers ahead of them. By not having to wait in line, customers can use the time before their turn as they choose. Jeremy Soo, Head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank said, “As the largest bank in Singapore, our branches are one of the most utilised and we are constantly exploring ways to enhance our customers’ branch banking experience. We also understand that time is a precious commodity so the crucial part of the SMS ‘Q’ service is that it provides queue information in advance, allowing our customers to decide how best to use their time. By removing standing queues and providing seats for our customers, we also hope to make the branch visit more comfortable for all our customers.” To use the SMS ‘Q’ service, customers simply need to text “Q” to the number tagged to the branch they want to visit. The mobile number is available at branches or via DBS/POSB’s mobile banking apps, DBS mBanking or POSB mBanking, under Q-Cam. Customers will subsequently receive an SMS menu where they can select the service they require. Once they have made their selection, they will receive their queue number as well as the number of customers that are being served ahead of them. If there is a longer wait time, customers will also receive a reminder SMS when their turn is nearing. Once their turn is up, customers can proceed directly to their assigned counter. If they miss their turn, they will receive an SMS with the option to rejoin the queue. The launch of the service is in line with recent initiatives introduced by DBS/POSB to provide new and innovative ways for customers to access the bank’s services, while enhancing their branch experience. This February, to help meet the higher demand for new notes during the Lunar New Year season, DBS/POSB was the first bank to introduce pop-up ATMs dispensing new notes and also made new notes withdrawal services available to customers at all 58 SingPost branches in Singapore. The project, which saw DBS/POSB placing 29 specially-configured pop-up ATMs to disburse new notes at 10 community clubs islandwide, was an instant hit with customers. From 2 to 21 February 2015, close to 75,000 customers visited the ATMs and SingPost outlets and made more than 180,000 transactions. In addition, with most of the ATMs being available round-the-clock, 80% of pop-up ATM users took the opportunity to withdraw new notes beyond branch opening hours. Earlier this month, DBS/POSB also announced that its number of mBanking users had crossed the one million mark. The bank has more than 2.2 million iBanking users and sees more than one million transactions being made per day on both its online and mobile platforms. In October 2014, in a bid to reduce balance enquiries at ATMs and provide mobile banking services to customers who own basic feature (non-smartphone) mobiles, DBS also introduced SMS Banking to its comprehensive suite of mobile banking offerings.

DBS RMB Index for Winning Enterprises falls to 57.2 in the fourth quarter of 2014 | 繁體,16 Feb 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_RMB_Index_for_Winning_Enterprises_falls_to_57_2_in_the_fourth_quarter_of_2014, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited is pleased to release the fourth-quarter 2014 findings of the DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) today. The index reading slightly fell to 57.2 from the previous quarter’s 58.1, amid deterioration in business performance among local companies. Business needs for RMB also reduced with only 29% of the companies saying they had RMB customer orders/invoices and trade settlements in the past 12 months, versus 44% in 3Q 2014. Companies are showing interest in a wider variety of RMB products Despite the drop in business needs for RMB, companies are showing interest across a broader range of RMB products. In 4Q 2014, the percentage of companies that said they are currently using or will consider using RMB payment and receivables services in the next 12 months increased to 28%, up from 20% in the previous quarter. Some 10% of companies said they are currently using or will consider using RMB trade services in the next 12 months, versus only 4% in 3Q 2014. Interest is growing across a broader range of RMB products, including term loans and letters of credit. Companies using trade services showed an increasing need for RMB services, such as deposits, payment and receivables, and trade services, in their operations. This is consistent with the increasing use of RMB for global payments. Of the companies that were using trade services, some 56% have either used RMB payment and receivables or would consider using them for these purposes in the next 12 months, compared with 41% in 3Q 2014. Some 42% have either used RMB trade services or would consider using them for these purposes in the next 12 months, up from 13% in the previous quarter. Tommy Ong, Executive Director, Treasury and Markets (Greater China), DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “The use of RMB products is expected to increase going forward as corporates adopt various hedging strategies to mitigate increasing exchange rate volatility. Also, more small and medium-sized enterprises tend to invoice in RMB because they may not have the experience or expertise to hedge foreign exchange risks effectively.” RMB to surpass the yen and rank fourth for global payments by end 2015 More companies are using RMB trade settlement accounts. Some 27% of companies said they used RMB trade settlement accounts in 4Q 2014, versus an average of 19.8% in 4Q 2013-3Q 2014. A record high 14% of companies said they were using RMB export trade settlement accounts, compared with an average of 7.5% in 4Q 2013-3Q 2014. Those who used import trade settlement accounts also slightly increased to 13%, from an average of 12.3% in 4Q 2013-3Q 2014. In 4Q 2014, 15% of companies said customer acceptance of RMB for trade settlement increased, while 73% said there was no change, and only 12% said acceptance decreased. These findings are consistent with the latest report issued by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). According to SWIFT, the RMB overtook the Canadian dollar as the fifth most-used currency for global payments in December 2014. The proportion of transactions denominated in RMB climbed to a record 2.2%, after hovering around 1.5% over the past year. The US dollar, euro, pound, and yen remained the four most-used currencies with respective shares of 44.6%, 28.3%, 7.9%, and 2.7%. Nathan Chow, Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said “China is the world’s largest trading country, and 25% of its foreign trade is now settled in RMB, which is not too far from the 30%–40% level for the yen for Japanese trade. Amid ongoing liberalisation efforts, more RMB capital will flow abroad and the number of transactions will increase, meaning spreads should narrow and the cost of trade should fall. That will further incentivise market participants to trade in RMB. We expect the RMB to surpass the yen and rank fourth for global payments by end 2015.” Policy initiatives continue to spark RMB personal investment in 2015 The DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) largely reflects the level of corporate usage and acceptance of RMB, which fell in 4Q 2014. Yet, the survey found an increase in the personal use of RMB following the removal of the RMB 20,000 daily conversion limit in November 2014. Specifically, 47% of the business decision makers said that they would consider increasing their personal investment in RMB products after the lifting of the cap. Some 69% said they would increase their investments by more than 10%. In addition to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, China is seeking to provide domestic residents with more investment channels. According to the People’s Bank of China, China’s citizens will be able to buy overseas equities and real estate. Talks are underway to give locals access to RMB capital markets in Singapore and London via an RQDII scheme. Offshore RMB liquidity can be further boosted through such policy initiatives. This is important against the backdrop of more balanced cross-border RMB flows. DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) offers a strategic tool for policy-makers, businesses and investors to track the actual usage and acceptance of RMB among Hong Kong companies as well as their sentiment towards future RMB adoption. DBS releases the findings of DRIVE on a quarterly basis. Fieldwork for the 4Q 2014 survey was conducted through telephone interviews with the business owners and decision makers of over 200 companies in Hong Kong.

Excluding one-time items of SGD 198 million, net profit increased 10% to SGD 3.85 billion. Total income grew 8% to SGD 9.62 billion from higher net interest margin, loan volumes and fee income. Allowance charges declined, with the non-performing loan rate improving to 0.9% and the allowance coverage of non-performing assets increasing to 163%. Full-year net profit growth underpinned by 8% increase in total income Full-year net interest income rose 14% to SGD 6.32 billion. Loans grew 9% in constant currency terms to SGD 276 billion from regional corporate borrowing and secured consumer loans. Net interest margin improved six basis points to 1.68% as loan pricing improved and securities yields were higher while deposit costs were stable. Fee income grew 8% to SGD 2.03 billion. The stronger performance was led by a 23% increase in wealth management fees from higher unit trust and bancassurance sales and a 27% rise in investment banking fees from increased debt capital market activities. Card fees were also higher. These increases were partially offset by lower stockbroking commissions. The improvement in fee income was offset by a 14% decline in other non-interest income to SGD 1.27 billion. Overall non-interest income fell 2% to SGD 3.30 billion. Total income rose 8% to SGD 9.62 billion, with all business segments contributing to the increase.

One-time items amounted to SGD 198 million, comprising a gain of SGD 223 million from the divestment of a stake in the Bank of the Philippine Islands less a donation of SGD 25 million to the National Gallery Singapore. Fourth-quarter earnings rise 4% from year ago For the fourth quarter, net profit increased 4% from a year ago to SGD 838 million. A 9% increase in total income to SGD 2.34 billion was offset by higher allowances. Net interest income rose 15% to SGD 1.67 billion as loans grew 9% in constant-currency terms and net interest margin rose 10 basis points to 1.71%. Fee income increased 5% to SGD 459 million, led by higher contributions from wealth management, cards and investment banking. The higher fee income was offset by a 20% decline in other non-interest income to SGD 207 million as a result of less favourable trading conditions. Income from treasury customer flows was stable. Total non-interest income was 4% lower at SGD 666 million. Expenses grew 9% to SGD 1.13 billion as higher staff costs were partially offset by lower computerisation expenses. Profit before allowances increased 8% to SGD 1.21 billion. Total allowances were 40% higher at SGD 211 million as specific allowances increased to SGD 157 million from SGD 91 million a year ago. Fourth-quarter earnings 17% below previous quarter Compared to the previous quarter, fourth-quarter earnings were 17% lower from seasonally lower trading income and higher general allowances in line with stronger loan growth. Business momentum remained healthy. Net interest income was 4% higher from loan growth and better net interest margin. Loans expanded 3% in constant-currency terms from corporate borrowing, trade loans and secured consumer loans. Net interest margin improved three basis points to 1.71% due to higher asset yields and disciplined management of deposit and funding costs. Fee income was 17% lower due to a high base for investment banking activities in the previous quarter and lower wealth management contributions. Other income declined 42% as a result of less favourable trading conditions as well as quieter markets in the fourth quarter. Total income declined 7% while expenses were 2% higher. Total allowances increased 19% from higher general allowances. Specific allowances were stable. Balance sheet remains strong Asset quality remained healthy. The non-performing loan rate of 0.9% was unchanged from the previous quarter and lower than the rate of 1.1% a year ago. Allowance coverage rose to a new high of 163% of non-performing assets compared to 135% a year ago. If collateral was considered, allowance coverage was 296%. There was ample liquidity to support business growth. Deposits rose 2% during the quarter and 7% during the year in constant-currency terms to SGD 317 billion, with the increase led by US-dollar deposits. DBS also maintained its leading market share of Singapore-dollar deposits. The loan-deposit ratio was at 87% while the Singapore-dollar and all-currency liquidity coverage ratios were in excess of 100%. DBS remained well capitalised. The Common Equity Tier-1 capital adequacy ratio was 13.1% and the total capital ratio was 15.3%. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said, “DBS hit a new milestone, with full-year profit exceeding SGD 4 billion in 2014. This is testament to the strength and resilience of the franchise. We believe that the multiple business engines we’ve built are sustainable and scalable. As the way in which people do banking is rapidly changing, we are also stepping up our investments in digital banking.” The Board proposed a final dividend of 30 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This will bring the full-year payout to 58 cents per share, unchanged from a year ago. The scrip dividend scheme will be applicable and scrip dividends will be issued at the average of the last-dealt share price on each of 27, 28 and 29 April 2015.

DBS launches venture debt for tech start-ups in Singapore,05 Feb 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_venture_debt_for_tech_start_ups_in_Singapore, Singapore ,"- Lending support to Singapore’s vision to build its version of Silicon Valley, DBS Bank today launched a programme which will provide financing to tech start-ups , expanding the range of capital-raising options available to technopreneurs. Today, start-ups in Singapore primarily rely on venture capital to fund their operations. By offering a dedicated venture debt solution to tech start-ups which are at the growth stage of their business life cycles, DBS is making available an alternative source of capital for these firms to tap on, with little or no dilution to their equity. Tech start-ups can use DBS venture debt for working capital, fixed assets acquisition and even project financing. DBS’ venture debt solution is being rolled out amid growing demand for such financing. According to a report from the Singapore Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (SVCA), Singapore is the No. 1 market for start-ups in Southeast Asia. Last year, USD 454 million worth of venture capital deals were done in Singapore, compared with USD 918 million invested in the rest of Southeast Asia. The amount of venture capital invested in Singaporean tech firms by funds totalled USD 1.71 billion in 2013. While that was behind China’s USD 3.46 billion, it was ahead of Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, according to data from Asian Venture Capital Journal. Funding devoted to Singapore’s tech firms, including from the government, skyrocketed in 2013 to account for 19% of funding for Asia. This is up from just USD 27.9 million, or 0.3%, in 2011. Said Lim Chu Chong, Head of SME Banking, DBS Bank, “As the bank that sparked the development of Singapore, we are pleased to be one of the first banks in Singapore to offer venture debt as an alternative capital-raising option for tech start-ups. Tech start-ups can use venture debt to complement venture capital, and buy more time and flexibility for their businesses to hit key development milestones, which can potentially increase their company valuations. We hope this will be a boost to the start-up eco-system in Singapore and help innovative tech companies scale up and reach profitability at a faster pace.” Welcoming the initiative by DBS, Hau Koh Foo, Head of Innovation & Enterprise at National Research Foundation, said, “We are encouraged by DBS coming on board to play a more active role in offering tech start-ups alternative funding sources. This will complement the various initiatives rolled out by the Singapore government to enable start-ups to gain access to funding, and contribute to Singapore’s success as a start-up friendly nation.” Said Lim Kuo-Yi, Managing Director of Monk’s Hill Ventures, “We are pleased to partner DBS in offering venture debt to tech start-ups. It complements venture capital by helping our portfolio companies extend their equity runway to reach their key value inflection points, without unnecessary dilution or concern of losing more ownership.” Said Samuel Lim, CEO of Reebonz, ""We applaud this initiative as it provides a viable alternative for young firms like Reebonz to diversify our funding options. Using a combination of equity and debt capital, start-ups can optimise their capital structure and strengthen their balance sheet ahead of the next round of venture fund raising.” Said Rosaline Koo, Founder of CXA and a DBS BusinessClass advisor, “For start-ups, it is important to partner a bank that has a suite of services and track record to support you through the various stages of your business, including an initial public offering or acquisition. With this new programme, DBS has demonstrated its commitment and ability to be a one-stop-shop for start-ups.” To qualify, tech start-ups must be strongly backed by DBS’ partner venture capitalists such as Vertex Venture, Monk’s Hill Ventures and Golden Gate Ventures. They should have raised at least SGD 1 million of Series A funding, be incorporated for at least two years, be in operation for at least one year and have demonstrated that their business model is commercially viable. For more information, please follow the “DBS VentureDebt” topic on the DBS BusinessClass app .

POSB brings back iconic National School Savings Campaign,23 Jan 2015,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/POSB_Brings_Bank_Iconic_National_School_Savings_Campaign, Singapore ,"- Having served generations of Singaporeans since 1877, POSB, the People’s Bank, today announced that it is bringing back the iconic POSB National School Savings Campaign – fondly known by many as the “POSB Saving Stamps Programme” – an initiative to encourage primary school students to cultivate the habit of saving. The savings campaign, reintroduced in conjunction with SG50, was instrumental in laying the foundation for the success of our nation and was unveiled today at a launch event by the Minister for Education, Mr. Heng Swee Keat. While the campaign retains some of its original elements, the bank has also taken an innovative approach to engaging the digitally savvy generation of today by introducing “Smiley Town”, a mobile gaming app which provides students with money saving tips and helps students track their savings. Many will remember the original National School Savings Campaign, first introduced in 1969 through the “Postal Savings Bank” – now known as POSB. The deposits generated by the campaign provided a valuable source of funds for the economic growth of Singapore, while cultivating values of savings and thrift among the youth. The campaign proved to be hugely popular across its run in the 1970s and 1980s, at its peak achieving 100% participation from schools. A recent POSB online poll conducted with 5,000 respondents indicated that 90% believe that having a National School Savings Campaign would be effective in cultivating a healthy savings habit amongst children. 89% also expressed their concerns that savings as a value among children have eroded in today’s affluent society. Said Jeremy Soo, Head of DBS Singapore Consumer Banking Group, “Many Singaporean adults – myself included – grew up with the National School Savings Campaign. I have very fond memories of collecting the stamps and watching my savings grow. Based on our survey, we note parents’ rising concerns about the erosion of savings as a value among the young. We feel it is important for students to participate in the physical act of saving money, and in keeping with the times, we also want to engage them digitally in a fun and interesting way.” In addition to “Smiley Town”, the bank is also increasing its outreach to the young via digital channels which they frequently visit or socialise on. Said Sim S. Lim, DBS Singapore Country Head, “Having served generations of Singaporeans from all walks of life, we have helped to shape values, such as thrift and savings, which have contributed to the success of our nation. As we move into the future, we will continue to innovate in the ways we engage and serve our customers. This is a significant year for Singapore and we are delighted to bring back the much loved POSB National School Savings Campaign.” To participate in the campaign, students can collect stamp cards from participating school bookstores, POSB/DBS branches, or any SingPost outlet from February 2 onwards. They can purchase stamps (at SGD 0.50 each) from participating school bookstores or SingPost outlets. Once the cards are filled with 20 stamps, they can be deposited into any POSB/DBS Quick Cheque Deposit location, and SGD 10 will be subsequently credited into the student’s POSBkids account. To provide greater incentive for students to save, POSB will offer a bonus SGD 1 for every SGD 10 saved by each student per month via this campaign. Said Karen Ngui, Head of DBS Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, “Both DBS and POSB are deeply woven into the fabric of the Singapore. Having played an integral role in Singapore’s development, we have lined up a broad range of initiatives to ignite possibilities and spark joy with our customers, employees and members of the community.” Initiatives by DBS/POSB to celebrate SG50 include the first pop-up ATMs in Singapore to make it more convenient for customers to obtain new notes during the Lunar New Year as well as the limited edition POSB Smiley Jubilee Gift Bag for all babies born this year. The bank earlier announced the establishment of a SGD 50 million DBS Foundation to give back to the community as well as a donation of SGD 25 million to the National Gallery Singapore. DBS will also be celebrating Singapore’s 50 th birthday with a SGD 3.5 million sponsorship of the 28 th Southeast Asian Games and its dragon boat and sailing races. Singaporeans have also been invited to share how they are transforming their neighbourhoods and social circles on the POSB NeighboursFirst.sg portal.

It was interactive and fun as there were the stamps to look forward too as well. We are glad that POSB is reviving this National School Savings Campaign initiative. It did not only help cultivate good savings habits among the children but also broadened their horizons through stamps to history and culture of Singapore and the world.” Branch manager Tan Kim Hong who joined SingPost in 1971 as a counter staff reminisced: “In the 70s, we would often see children in the post offices queuing up excitedly to present their stamp cards filled with stamps to open a saving account or credit savings into their account. Some would also come to the post office to buy stamps to paste onto the stamp cards. It was heartening to see children developing good saving habits.” EZ-Link Pte Ltd Nicholas Lee, CEO of EZ-Link Pte Ltd, said, “EZ-Link is excited to introduce a new cashless way for students to save as part of the National School Savings Campaign. Besides inculcating saving habits in our next generation, we are also taking the opportunity to educate them on the convenience of cashless payments, starting at a young age.” Pacific Bookstores Teoh Hai Thow, Executive Director of Pacific Bookstores, said, “As one of the pioneering bookshop operators established in 1976, Pacific Bookstores is excited to partner POSB and SingPost for the launch of the National School Savings Campaign. We strongly believe that it will be beneficial to students in the primary schools and will cultivate good saving habits, which has deteriorated over the years.” Merchandising Executive Karen Yap, who participated in the National School Savings Campaign when it was first launched recalls fondly: “I remember the excitement my friends and I had in a bid to complete the stamp cards. We would race to the bookshop, where the stamps were sold. Now that I work in Pacific Bookstores, it definitely has brought about a nostalgic feeling and I hope it will cultivate the habit in the younger generation to save.” About POSB A part of the DBS Group, POSB is the largest local bank in Singapore with 4 million customers.

DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises falls to 58.1 in the third quarter | 繁體,11 Nov 2014,https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_RMB_Index_for_VVinning_Enterprises_falls_to_58_1_in_the_third_quarter, Hong Kong ,"- DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited is pleased to release the third-quarter 2014 findings of the DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) today. The index reading fell to 58.1 from the previous quarter’s 60.4, amid slower economic growth and reduced business needs for RMB. There is a notable decline in the actual and expected usage of RMB payment and receivable services as well as RMB trade services among local corporations. Business needs and usage of RMB products retreated In 3Q 2014, some 44% of companies said they had RMB customer orders/invoices and trade settlement in the last 12 months, versus 45% in the previous quarter. The percentage of companies that said they would use RMB for these purposes in the next 12 months plummeted to 55% from last quarter’s 69%. The percentage of companies using RMB products fell to 28% in 3Q 2014, from 34% in the previous quarter. In 3Q 2014, only 20% of companies said they are currently using or will consider using RMB payment and receivables services in the next 12 months, versus 32% in the previous quarter. The percentage of companies that said they are currently using or will consider using RMB trade services in the next 12 months fell by half to 4% in 3Q 2014, from 8% in 2Q 2014. Chris Leung, Executive Director and Senior Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “Business needs for RMB is a key indicator of actual RMB acceptance and usage at the corporate level. As Chinese economic growth continues to slow due to structural reforms, we anticipate the growth of business needs for RMB by local corporations to slow in tandem. On the other hand, the usage of RMB products is expected to rebound as corporations take on various hedging strategies to mitigate the increase in exchange rate volatility.” Companies’ volume of mainland business being the key factor affecting their RMB usage Some 31% of companies that had used RMB products in the third quarter said they would increase their RMB usage when their volume of mainland businesses increases. Some 15% said they would increase their RMB product usage if there are supporting policies, while only 9% thought exchange rates would impact their usage level. Chris Leung said: “The initial depreciation scare following a widening of the RMB trading band is apparently over. Many more companies (34% in 3Q 2014 vs 20% in 2Q 2014) anticipate further RMB appreciation in the next 12 months. That said, 38% of companies prefer the RMB to depreciate if they had a choice.” Some 80% of the business decision makers surveyed said they did not have a good understanding of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect pilot programme. Nathan Chow, Vice President and Economist, Group Research, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, said: “Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect will provide an additional avenue for RMB investments. As RMB-denominated equities become more accessible, the demand for RMB-denominated structured products such as RMB equity-linked notes (ELN) and equity-linked deposits (ELD) is expected to surge. We believe investors will become increasingly familiarised with details of the Stock Connect after its launch.” Large corporations remain resilient with increased demand for dim sum bonds Ginger Cheng, Managing Director and Large Hong Kong & China Corporates Head, DBS Bank, Hong Kong Branch, said: “The large amount of dim sum bond refinancings this year and the lack of offshore RMB investment options have continued to drive the huge demand for RMB bonds. Year-to-date gross issuance of offshore RMB bonds reached RMB 368.3 billion, 32% higher than the full-year figure of RMB 280 billion in 2013.” “There is an improvement of investor sentiment as a result of higher investment returns from RMB bonds. As offshore bond issuance is more flexible and cost effective compared with onshore, the momentum of dim sum bond issuance is likely to continue for the rest of 2014,” Ginger Cheng added. DBS RMB Index for VVinning Enterprises (DRIVE) offers a strategic tool for policy-makers, businesses and investors to track the actual usage and acceptance of RMB among Hong Kong companies as well as their sentiment towards future RMB adoption. DBS releases the findings of DRIVE on a quarterly basis. Fieldwork for the 3Q 2014 report was conducted through telephone interviews with the business owners and decision makers of over 200 companies in Hong Kong.
